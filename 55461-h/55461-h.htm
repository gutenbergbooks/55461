<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The celebration this year of the Jubilee of the
Victoria Cross may be offered as sufficient excuse
for the appearance of this volume. Such a notable
event deserves to be fittingly commemorated, and it
is in the hope that it will be accepted as a standard
work on the subject that the present book is put
forth. My original intention of telling the stories
of <em>all</em> the V.C. exploits was found to be impracticable
within the limit of space prescribed. A selection,
therefore, has been made, and these instances&mdash;a very
large number&mdash;have been narrated more or less at
length. The history of the Decoration has been
brought right up to date.</p>

<p>In such a book as this, accuracy is of course of the
first importance, and in my account of the deeds that
won the Cross I have been at considerable pains to
verify the smallest particulars. To this end the
<cite>London Gazette</cite> and other authentic sources have been
consulted, while in many cases the information has
been obtained from the V.C. men themselves. It is
possible, however, that errors have crept in despite
the care exercised, and I shall be grateful if any
reader who detects a misstatement will notify me of
the fact, that the correction may be made in a future
edition.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORIGIN OF THE VICTORIA CROSS AND THE
FIRST PRESENTATION.</span></h2>

<p>Every nation loves to honour the brave deeds of
her sons. We know how in olden times this was
done, how the Romans conferred a “Civic Crown”
upon the hero who saved a citizen’s life, and inscribed
his name in letters of gold upon the marble wall in
the Capitol. In these modern days it is the custom
to bestow a medal or similar decoration upon the
bravest of the brave, as a public mark of appreciation
of their heroism.</p>

<p>So Russia has its Order of St. George, which is conferred
solely for exceptional gallantry on the field of
battle; Austria its Order of Maria Theresa (so exclusive
that there are not more than twenty living
possessors of its Cross); Prussia its Order “Pour le
Mérite”; France its Legion of Honour and War Medal;
and the United States a “Medal of Honour” which
carries no privileges and confers no rank on the bearer,
and which, curiously enough, is sent to the recipient
through the post.</p>

<p>Great Britain’s symbol of the grand democracy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
valour is a little Maltese cross of bronze, insignificant
to look at beside many a more showy medal, and
intrinsically worth only fourpence halfpenny, but the
most coveted decoration of all that our soldiers and
sailors can aspire to.</p>

<p>Somewhat reminiscent of a badge awarded to the
28th Regiment after the siege of Badajoz in the
Peninsular War,&mdash;a badge which bore a crown, a star,
and the letters V.S., signifying “Valiant Stormer,”&mdash;the
Victoria Cross is adorned with a crown surmounted
by a lion, and a scroll bearing the simple inscription
“For Valour.” On the reverse side of the medal is
given the date or dates of the act of bravery for which
it has been awarded, while the name of the recipient
is inscribed at the back of the bar to which it is
attached by a V. The Cross, which is cast from
cannon that were taken at Sebastopol, is suspended
from its wearer’s left breast by a piece of ribbon, blue
for the Navy and crimson for the Army.</p>

<p>Such is the world-famed Victoria Cross. What,
then, was its origin? For answer to this we must go
back to the days of the Crimean War, fifty years ago.
Up to this time decorations for distinguished services
in the field were very sparsely distributed. The men
of Wellington’s day were thought to be sufficiently
honoured if they were “mentioned in despatches.”
But after the Crimean campaign, in which British
soldiers did such prodigies of valour, a feeling arose
that some medal should be struck as a reward for
bravery in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the Charge of the Light Brigade at
Balaclava that inspired the idea, but, however this may
be, a certain Captain Scobell, R.N., sometime M.P.
for Bath, set on foot an agitation which at length drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the attention of the authorities and led in due course
to the institution of the Victoria Cross. The new
decoration, which by Queen Victoria’s special desire
bore her own name, was first announced in the
<cite>London Gazette</cite> on February 5th, 1856. The present
year, therefore, celebrates its jubilee.</p>

<p>As stated in the original Royal Warrant, which is
given in full in the Appendix, the Cross entitles all its
bearers below commissioned rank to a pension of £10
a year, with an additional £5 for each extra clasp or
bar,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, by a recent clause, an increase to £50 a year
in cases where the recipient is incapacitated by old age
or ill-health. Another important new alteration in
the rules provides that if a man dies in winning
the V.C. the decoration shall be handed to his relatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the great distinction of the Victoria Cross
that it may be won by the humblest member of the
services. “Linesman and Lord,” private soldier,
common sailor, Field-Marshal and Admiral,
are all on a level on the Roll of Valour. Out of the 522
Crosses which have been bestowed up to the present time
(June 1906), it has been, or is still, worn by
three Field-Marshals, six Admirals, one clergyman,
three civilians, and twenty-five Army doctors.</p>

<p>Furthermore, how truly democratic is the decoration
is shown by the fact that it has been won by three
men of colour&mdash;Seaman Hall, a negro serving in
Captain Peel’s Naval Brigade at Lucknow, and
Sergeant Gordon and Private Hodge, both of the
West India Regiment.</p>

<p>Of the different campaigns in which the Cross
was won the Indian Mutiny yielded the greatest
number, 182. The Crimean War accounted for
111; the recent South African War comes third
with 78; while the Zulu War provided 23; and
the Afghan War of 1870-80, 16. In the list of
V.C. regiments&mdash;excepting the Royal Artillery
and the Royal Engineers, which have forty-one and twenty-seven
Crosses to their credit&mdash;the South Wales
Borderers top the list with sixteen. Next in order
come the Rifle Brigade (fourteen), the King’s Royal
Rifle Corps, the 9th Lancers, and the Gordon Highlanders
(thirteen each), and the Seaforth Highlanders
(eleven). The Black Watch and the Cameronians
(Scottish Rifles) total ten each.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to note, too, in this connection how
many V.C.’s have been won by Colonial troopers, for
the most part in the late South African War.
No fewer than twenty-five were awarded to South Africans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders, showing
of what sterling metal were these Sons of the Empire
who crossed the seas to fight at the call of the Mother
Country.</p>

<p class="tb">The first presentation of the V.C. took place
on June 26th, 1857, the year after the close of the
Crimean War. The scene of the ceremony was Hyde
Park, and on that beautiful summer morning the
sun shone down upon a brilliant spectacle. A large
body of troops under the command of the veteran
Sir Colin Campbell, comprised of Life Guards, Dragoons,
Hussars, Royal Engineers, Artillery, and other regiments,
together with a detachment of smart-looking Bluejackets,
were drawn up in imposing array, and a vast
number of people of all ranks had assembled to await
the coming of Royalty, for the Queen herself was to
pin the Crosses on to the heroes’ breasts with her own
hand.</p>

<p>Just before ten o’clock, to the booming of a royal
salute, her Majesty, with the Prince Consort, the
Crown Prince of Prussia, the Prince of Wales and
his brother Prince Alfred (the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha),
all on horseback, rode into the Park
and took their places near the dais that had been
prepared. On a small table near by, showing up
strongly against the scarlet cloth with which it was
covered, lay the Crosses that were to be bestowed
that morning. The little band of sixty-two heroes,
headed by Lieutenant Knox, of the Rifle Brigade, meanwhile
stood at ease a little distance off, the observed
of all observers, until the signal was given, and then
one by one they came forward as Lord Panmure,
the then Secretary for War, read out their names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>As a complete list of these first recipients of the
V.C. is given at the end of this volume I need not
enumerate them here, but there were one or two,
notably Lieutenant (now Rear-Admiral) Lucas, the
first man to be awarded the decoration, Lieutenant
Hewett (“Bully Hewett” as he was popularly known),
the gallant Commander (late Rear-Admiral) Bythesea,
and Lieutenant Knox, whose empty sleeve bore
eloquent witness to his daring bravery at the storming
of the Redan, who stood out from the rest.
And hardly less conspicuous among those present
were Lord Cardigan, at the head of the 11th Hussars
and mounted on the very horse that carried him
through the Balaclava Charge, and Fenwick Williams,
the gallant defender of Kars.</p>

<p>The presentation, the most historic ceremony that
Hyde Park has ever witnessed, was over in barely
more than ten minutes. After the last Cross had
been pinned on Major Bourchier’s breast the little band
of heroes was drawn up in line again, and a review
of the troops brought the proceedings to a close.</p>

<p class="tb">A truly glorious and inspiring record is that of the
V.C. The stories of how the Cross was won, though
they cannot be told as fully as one could wish, make
a Golden Book of Valour that every British boy
should be made familiar with, as the sons of the old
Norsemen were made familiar with the sagas of their
heroes. For they tell not merely of physical courage,
which the ancients extolled as the highest of all the
virtues, but of that moral courage which demands
even more fully our admiration.</p>

</div>

<p>One’s heart warms at the recollection of the giant
M’Bean slaying his eleven sepoys single-handed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Lucknow, but his heroism pales before that of
Kavanagh or of Surgeon Home and the other heroes
of “Dhoolie Square.” Their gallant deeds were not
performed in the fierce heat of battle, when in the
excitement of the moment a man may be so lifted out
of himself as to become unconsciously a veritable
paladin, but done quietly, from a high sense of duty
and in the name of humanity, in the face of what
looked like certain death.</p>

<p>There is room only in the succeeding chapters for
a recital of a limited number of the deeds that won
the Cross. One would like to tell of all, making
no exceptions, but such a task is beyond the scope of
this volume. The most striking and most notable
acts in the annals of the V.C. have accordingly been
selected, and while keeping strictly to fact the
endeavour has been made to present them in a
worthily attractive setting.</p>

<p>And in calling to mind the heroism of the brave men
who figure in these pages let us not forget those who
may be said to have equally earned the distinction
but who for some reason or other were passed over.
Of such were Chaplain Smith, who was one of the
heroes of Rorke’s Drift; Gumpunt Rao Deo Ker, the
Mahratta sowar who stood by Lieutenant Kerr’s side
at Kolapore, saving his leader’s life more than once in
that terrible fight; and the gallant little bugler boy,
Tom Keep, of the Grenadier Guards, who, while the
battle of Inkerman was at its height and bullets were
whistling round him (one actually passed through his
jacket), went about tending the wounded on the field.
These are names among many that deserve to be
inscribed high up on the scroll which perpetuates the
memory of our bravest of the brave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the 522 winners of the V.C. some 200 are
alive at the present time. Death has been busy of
late years in thinning the ranks. Only the other day,
as it seems, we lost Seaman Trewavas, Mr. Ross
Lowis Mangles (one of the few civilians decorated),
General Channer, and Baker Pasha. We have,
however, still with us the senior winner of the
distinction, Rear-Admiral Lucas, whose exploit is
narrated at length in its proper place, Field-Marshals
Lord Roberts, Sir George White, and Sir Evelyn
Wood, Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon, General Sir
Redvers Buller, and many another hero of high rank.
May the day be far distant when their names have
to be erased from the survivors’ roll!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CRIMEA.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF THE ALMA.</span></h2>

<p>It was in the Crimean War, as noted in the preceding
chapter, that the first Victoria Crosses
were won. I do not purpose giving a history of the
war here, for space does not permit of it, nor would
it be altogether in place. But for a proper appreciation
of the incidents which I am about to describe it
is necessary to say something about the events which
led up to the war. The reader who wants to obtain
a completer grasp of the campaign, the first great
European war that our army had been engaged in
since the war against Napoleon, will of course turn to
an authoritative history for information, not forgetting
to keep a map in front of him while he reads.</p>

<p>The war in the Crimea originated in the aggressive
movements of Russia against her old enemy the Turk.
For centuries the Crimea itself had been the scene
of constant warfare between the two nations, its independence
as a separate state under the rule of its
own Khans being at length secured towards the end
of the eighteenth century, in the hope that peace
would come to the troubled district.</p>

<p>But it was not to be so. Russia could not keep
her hands off the desired province, the possession of
which meant a step gained in the direction of Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and the conquest of the Ottomans.
Accordingly the treaty with the Turks was violated
by the Empress Catherine, and the Crimea was seized
again by the Russians. Fortresses of formidable
dimensions now sprang up on the borders, the greatest
and most famous of these being the naval arsenal of
Sebastopol, which was built at the southern extremity
of the peninsula, in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>In due time the Tsar Nicholas I. ascended the
throne of Muscovy, and, believing that the hostility
of France towards England needed little to be fanned
into flame, he thought the time propitious to carry
out his ambitious scheme of conquest. With France
involved in a war with this country he had no reason
to fear interference with his plans. Having picked a
quarrel with the Sultan, therefore, on a matter of
dispute between the Greek and Roman Catholic
Churches, relating to the guardianship of the Holy
Places, especially the Holy Sepulchre in Palestine,
the Tsar flung an army into the provinces of the
Danube.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without his host. In the
face of this common danger (for the downfall of the
Turks meant a Russian menace of the whole of
Europe), England and France sank their differences
and joined forces against the Russians. In obstinate
mood, and confident in the strength of his huge army,
the Tsar held on his way, with the result that the
Allies declared war. This was in 1854.</p>

<p>Contrary to Russian expectations, the war opened
in the Crimea. Here the combined fleets made their
appearance in September of the same year, the troops
landing on the western coast. The English army was
under the command of Lord Raglan, the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
commander-in-chief being Marshal St. Arnaud.
Marching southward towards Sebastopol, at which a
blow was aimed, the allied army gained its first
victories at Alma and Balaclava. Then commenced
the long and memorable siege of Sebastopol, which
was not reduced until September of the following
year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, was fought the great
battle of Inkerman, “the soldiers’ battle,” as it has
been called, one of the most terrible fights that
Europe has seen. This took place in November
1854.</p>

<p>The winter, spring, and summer of the following
year were taken up with the siege operations, which
progressed but slowly owing to the severity of the
winter and the many natural difficulties to be overcome.
Our troops, too, as is now a matter of history,
were scandalously ill-equipped for the campaign, and
when we read of how badly they were clothed and fed,
of what little provision there was for the care of the
wounded, and altogether of the gross mismanagement
that characterised the conduct of the campaign, we
feel all the more pride that our men fought so well
and achieved so much success in the face of such
tremendous odds.</p>

<p>The tale of those eleven months, from October
1854 to September 1855, is one of sorties, of sapping
and mining, of desperate deeds done in the trenches
in the dead of night, of the gradual reducing of
the Sebastopol outworks. Great things were done by
our men at the attacks on the Mamelon Tower and
the Redan, and by the French at the storming of the
Malakoff, the capture of the last-named giving the
command of the fortress. On the night that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Malakoff fell the Russians evacuated the town, and
Sebastopol was taken possession of by the Allies.</p>

<p>By the Peace of Paris, which was concluded on
March 30th, 1856, the war came to an end, and our
army, sadly reduced in numbers by cholera and other
diseases, more than by the enemy’s shells and bullets,
returned home.</p>

<p>In giving an outline of the Crimean campaign
mention must not be omitted of the British fleet sent
into the Baltic at an early stage in the hostilities.
This fleet was unsuccessful in doing much damage to
the Russian ships which sought refuge behind the
strong fortresses of Cronstadt and Sveaborg, but it
stormed and took Bomarsund and the Äland Islands.
In the following year (1855) it renewed the attack,
and after a determined bombardment succeeded in
partially destroying Sveaborg.</p>

<p>It was in this naval campaign, and in the operations
in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, that our
Bluejackets and Marines did such signal service, and
that several of them won the right to put V.C. after
their names.</p>

<p class="tb">Five of the Crosses won at the battle of the Alma
were gained in defence of the colours.</p>

<p>In the advance on the Russian batteries which
were posted on the heights, the 23rd Royal Welsh
Fusiliers formed one of the regiments on the left wing,
the French attacking on the right. It was a perilous
climb up the precipitous rocky slopes, and particularly
so for a marked man like he who bore the colours.
Young Lieutenant Anstruther, a mere lad of eighteen,
who proudly carried the Queen’s colours, learnt this
to his cost, for when he was within a few yards of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
nearest Russian earthwork a bullet through the heart
laid him low.</p>

<p>In a moment a private had caught up the silken
banner now sadly stained with blood, but Sergeant
Luke O’Connor, a young Irishman of twenty-four,
who had followed close on poor Anstruther’s heels
and had been himself struck down, regained his feet
although badly wounded in the breast, and claimed
the flag. “Come on, 23rd!” he shouted. “Follow
me!”</p>

<p>It was in vain that the gallant sergeant was
ordered to the rear to have his wound attended to;
he refused to abandon the colours, and right through
that fierce fight he accompanied the Fusiliers, bearing
a charmed life, as was made evident later. When
the flag was inspected at the close of the action it was
found to be riddled with bullet holes, having been hit
in at least twenty-six places.</p>

<p>O’Connor received a commission for his bravery on
this occasion in addition to the Cross for Valour, but
he did not exchange from the regiment. Loyal to
the corps he loved, he remained in it, and in time rose
to command it.</p>

<p>On the same day another Welsh Fusilier, Captain
Bell, distinguished himself by capturing a Russian
gun which was limbered up and being dragged from
the redoubt. Leaving his company and dashing after
it alone, he pointed his revolver at the head of the
driver, who incontinently dismounted and bolted.</p>

<p>A private then coming to his aid, Captain Bell
turned the gun team round, and was returning in
triumph to his comrades when Sir George Brown, his
superior officer, angrily ordered him back to his
place in the regiment, reprimanding him for having quitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it without leave. He had to relinquish the gun forthwith,
but some hours later, when he and his remnant
of men marched in, he learnt to his great satisfaction
that the gun was still in the English lines. The
captured horses, it is recorded, were employed in one
of our batteries for some time afterwards, while the
gun itself was taken to Woolwich, where I believe it
is still to be seen.</p>

<p>For this action, which had not escaped notice despite
his commander’s rebuke, Captain Bell received
the Cross, but had it not been awarded then he would
have undoubtedly won it later at Inkerman, where he
displayed exceptional gallantry. Both O’Connor and
Captain Bell became Major-Generals in after years;
the ex-sergeant of the Welsh Fusiliers, who is still in
the land of the living, enjoying the distinction of being
one of the two V.C.’s who have risen to that high
grade from the ranks.</p>

<p>The second of the Crosses bestowed for defending
the colours fell to Lieutenant Lindsay, of the Scots Fusilier
Guards, afterwards well known as Lord Wantage.</p>

<p>At a critical moment in the battle an order given
to the Royal Welsh to retire was mistaken by the
Scots Guards as meant for them, and they began to
retreat in considerable disorder. Lieutenant Lindsay,
who carried the regimental colours, stood his ground
with his escort, endeavouring in vain to rally the broken
ranks. The tide of men swept past him to the rear,
however, and the little knot of soldiers round the
colours was isolated. In this perilous position they
were fiercely attacked by a body of Russians, the
escort falling almost to a man, and leaving Lindsay
and a fellow-officer to stand back to back and keep off
the enemy with revolvers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Help was speedily forthcoming, however. Seeing
their officer’s danger, Sergeants Knox and M’Kechnie,
with Private Reynolds, hastened to his side and
successfully held the Russians in check until the
regiment re-formed and advanced again. All three
men, it is satisfactory to add, were similarly
decorated.</p>

<p>Of Sergeant Knox more was heard later,
especially at the storming of the Redan, where he
lost an arm. By this time he had been promoted to
a lieutenancy and transferred to the Rifle Brigade,
from which he subsequently retired with the rank
of Major.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRIMEA.&mdash;IN THE BALACLAVA CHARGES.</span></h2>

<p>It is not remembered as it should be that there
were two brilliant charges made at Balaclava, on
that grey day of October 25th, 1854. Tennyson’s
stirring lines in honour of the Charge of the Light
Brigade have given enduring fame to the “noble Six
Hundred,” but the exploit of the “Three Hundred,”
the Heavy Brigade, should make the name of Balaclava
equally thrilling to us.</p>

<p>The Heavy Brigade was composed of squadrons of
the 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards, Scots Greys,
Inniskilling Dragoons, and the 1st Royals, under the
command of Brigadier-General Yorke Scarlett. At
an early stage of the fight Scarlett was proceeding
with his brigade to the support of the “thin red line”
which was bearing the brunt of the Russian attack,
when suddenly a huge mass of Russian cavalry,
Cossacks and others, 3000 strong, loomed up on the
heights to their left.</p>

<p>The situation was a perilous one, as the General saw
in a glance. The launching of that great crowd of
Russians upon the valley below meant annihilation
for his little force. With a quick command to
“wheel into line,” Scarlett gave orders for the brigade
to form up, facing the enemy. By some blunder,
however, the movement was not properly executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and when the Russians flung out in a wide-spreading
crescent to envelop the few hundreds of British redcoats
below them, two squadrons of the Scots Greys with
one of the 6th Inniskillings were left in front to
receive the first shock of the attack.</p>

<p>With that menacing horde of grey-coated, black-bearded
Russians, poised like a hawk about to swoop
upon its prey, there was no time for pause. Shrill
on the air the “Charge!” rang out, and with Scarlett
leading them, the little advance body of “Heavies”&mdash;300
men of the Scots Greys and Inniskillings&mdash;dashed
off to meet the foe.</p>

<p>We have no such details of the fight as were forthcoming
after the Charge of the Light Brigade, but
we know that it was a most desperate affair. For
every one of that handful of men, flung into a mass of
the enemy that outnumbered them many times over,
it was a hand-to-hand struggle for life of the most
heroic kind. For a few moments they were lost to
sight. Then out of the heaving, surging multitude
the black bearskins and brass helmets of the Scotsmen
and Irishmen broke into view here and there, while
their sabres flashed in the sun as they hewed their
way through.</p>

<p>It was a battle of giants. What wonder that the
Russians gave for a brief moment under the fierce
onset?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There’s fear in their faces; they shrink from the shock;</div>
<div class="verse">They will open the door, only loud enough knock;</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right">“Scarlett’s Three Hundred,” Gerald Massey.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this juncture the other squadrons that had been
left behind came galloping to the rescue. Into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
swaying mass they plunged, and soon afterwards
“Cossack and Russian,” reeling from the sabre-stroke
as they did again a little later, fell back in confusion.
The peril was past, the day won.</p>

<p>Of how Brigadier-General Scarlett, Lieutenant
Elliot, Captain Williams and Major Clarke of the
Scots Greys, and the other officers who led that fierce
charge, bore themselves, the regimental records tell
more than do the history books. Very few escaped
unscathed, and there were many like Elliot, who had
no fewer than fifteen wounds, sword cuts and lance
thrusts. And as with the officers, so was it with the
men. There was not one but proved himself a hero
that day. We can well understand how old Sir
Colin Campbell was for once moved to emotion, as
bareheaded he greeted the victors with the words,
“Greys, gallant Greys! I am an old man, but if I
were young again I would be proud to ride in your
ranks!”</p>

<p>Where all men are brave it is not easy to single
out any for special distinction. But in that terrible
death-ride there were two who merited honour above
their comrades, Sergeant-Major Grieve and Sergeant
Ramage. The former in the heat of the engagement
saw an officer in imminent danger of being
cut down. Riding to the rescue, he swept like a
whirlwind upon the Russians, cutting off the head
of one at a single blow and scattering the rest by
the fury of his onslaught. For this deed he won a
well-deserved Cross.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ramage, like Grieve also of the Scots
Greys, saved at least two lives on that day. He
rescued first Private MacPherson, whom a body of
Russians had hemmed in and who was fighting against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
odds that must have proved too much for him ultimately.
Later on, when the “Heavies” were covering
the retreat of the Light Brigade, a private named
Gardiner was seen to be in a terrible plight. His
horse was lagging behind the others, and one of the
private’s legs had been shattered by a round-shot.
The first to see Gardiner’s situation, Ramage rushed
impetuously to his help, and although exposed to a
cross fire that placed him in momentary danger for
his life, he nobly carried in the wounded soldier to a
place of safety.</p>

<p>These were the actions that gained the brave
sergeant the V.C., but they do not complete the story
of his exploits that day. After the Charge of the
Heavy Brigade, in which he had borne so distinguished
a part, Ramage’s horse, a stubborn brute, would not
follow the retreating Russians. No amount of spurring
would induce it to go in any direction save that
of home. Nothing daunted, the sergeant dismounted
and, leaving his charger to find its own way back,
actually rushed over on foot to the nearest Russian
lines, collared a man and brought him back prisoner!</p>

<p>The story of the Charge of the Light Brigade has
been told a score of times. There is nothing to be
added to it now, for the voices of its gallant leaders,
of Cardigan, Morris, and Nolan, are hushed in death,
and we shall never know what were the true facts of
the case. That “someone had blundered” is at
least certain. It is hard to believe that the order
was actually given for such a brilliant but useless
charge.</p>

<p>Yet so Lord Cardigan interpreted the instructions
brought to him by Captain Nolan, as the Light
Brigade, consisting of the 17th Lancers, the 4th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
13th Dragoons, and two regiments of Hussars, was
drawn up in the North Valley, on the other side of
those hills whereon the Russian cavalry had been
routed by Scarlett’s brigade. At the other end of the
valley was a strong force of Russians, formed up
behind a formidable battery of some thirty cannon.
The order&mdash;wrongly given or misunderstood&mdash;was
that the Light Brigade should advance and carry
these guns.</p>

<p>It was over a mile from the brigade’s position to
that of the Russians. At a trot, then at a gallop,
the Six Hundred, led by Cardigan in his striking
hussar uniform, set off on their death-ride. Tennyson’s
words, “Cannon to right of them, cannon to
left of them, cannon in front of them volley’d and
thunder’d,” are literally true. When the astonished
Russians realised what was happening they opened
a terrible fire with their batteries. Shot and shell
hurtled through the ranks again and again, laying
many a brave fellow low; but without wavering the Six
Hundred closed up the gaps and pressed on to their goal.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes from the time the fatal
order was received the Light Brigade had disappeared
in the smoke of the Russian batteries, riding clean
over the guns and sabreing the gunners as they stood
linstock in hand at their posts. Then ensued as
terrific a hand-to-hand combat as has ever been
chronicled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in that ride back, when a large body of
grey-coated lancers rode down upon their flank, and
the Russian artillerymen rallying to their guns fired
indiscriminately into the mass of English and Russians,
that the other Balaclava Crosses were won.</p>

<p>Major John Berryman, the most distinguished of
the seven heroes of the Charge who were awarded the
decoration, has told the story of his exploit himself,
told it modestly and simply as becomes a brave
man, but we can fill in the details of the picture for
ourselves as we read.</p>

<p>At the time of the Charge Berryman was Troop-Sergeant-Major
in the 17th Lancers, well known as
“the Duke of Cambridge’s Own” and “the Death or
Glory Boys.” In the last mad leap at the guns, the
mare he was riding was badly hit, and he dismounted,
when he found that he too had been wounded in the
leg. As he stood debating in his mind whether or
not to shoot the mare, Captain Webb, on horseback,
came up. He also had been struck in the leg, and to
his query as to what he had better do, Berryman
replied, “Keep to your horse, sir, and get back as
far as you can.”</p>

<p>Webb thereupon turned and rode back, while the
sergeant-major, catching a loose horse, attempted to
follow suit. But his new steed had its breastplate
driven into its chest, and hardly had he mounted ere
it fell to the ground. Giving up the idea of rejoining
his regiment in the mêlée, he was making his way back
on foot when he caught sight of Captain Webb, who had
halted a little distance off, the acute pain of his wound
preventing him riding farther.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant George Smith, of my own regiment,”
says Berryman in his account, “coming by, I got him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to stand at the horse’s head whilst I lifted the captain
off. Having accomplished this, I assisted Smith to
mount Webb’s horse and ride for a stretcher, taking
notice where we were. By this time the Russians
had got back to their guns and reopened fire. I saw
six men of my own regiment get together to recount
to each other their escapes. Seeing their danger, I
called to them to separate, but too late, for a shell
dropped amongst them, and I don’t think one escaped
alive.”</p>

<p>Hearing him call to the lancers, Captain Webb
asked Berryman what he thought the Russians would
do. Berryman answered that they were sure to
pursue, unless the Heavy Brigade came to the
rescue.</p>

<p>“Then you had better consult your own safety, and
leave,” said the captain.</p>

<p>Berryman shook his head. “I shall not leave you
now, sir,” he replied, adding that if they were made
prisoners they would go together.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Sergeant Farrell hove in sight,
and at Berryman’s call he came over. The retreat of
the Light Brigade from the guns was already beginning,
and the confusion and danger was augmented
by the onslaught of the Russian lancers, who had now
ridden down upon the devoted remnant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="390" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“I GOT HIM TO STAND AT THE HORSE’S HEAD WHILST I LIFTED
THE CAPTAIN OFF.”&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_22">Page 22.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The position of the wounded officer and his helpers
was indeed precarious. Bullets and shells were flying
by them, and at any moment a Cossack lance might
have laid them low. But neither Berryman nor
Farrell hesitated or thought of saving his own skin.
Making a chair of their hands, they raised the captain
from the ground and carried him in this way for some
two hundred yards, until Webb’s leg again became very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
painful. A private of the 13th Dragoons, named
Malone, was requisitioned to support the officer’s
legs, and another start was made.</p>

<p>The rear of the Greys was at last reached in safety,
and here the sergeant-major procured a tourniquet
which he screwed on to Webb’s right thigh (“I could
not have done it better myself,” said the regimental
doctor afterwards), together with a stretcher.</p>

<p>We will let Berryman take up the story himself at
this point.</p>

<p>“I and Farrell now raised the stretcher and carried
it for about fifty yards, and again set it down. I was
made aware of an officer of the Chasseurs d’Afrique
being on my left by his placing his hand upon my
shoulder. I turned and saluted. Pointing to Captain
Webb, but looking at me, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Your officer?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! and you sergeant?’ looking at the stripes
on my arm.</p>

<p>“‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! If you were in French service, I would
make you an officer on the spot.’ Then, standing in
his stirrups and extending his right hand, he said,
‘Oh! it was grand, it was <i lang="fr">magnifique</i>, but it is not
war, it is not war!’”</p>

<p>This French officer was General Morris.</p>

<p>Resuming their task, Berryman and Farrell got the
captain to the doctors, who discovered that the shin
bone of his leg had been shattered. Farrell turning
faint at the sight of the terrible wound, the sergeant-major
was instructed to take him away, and this was
the cause of bringing him near enough to the Duke of
Cambridge and Lord Cardigan to hear the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
say as he viewed the remnant that had come
“through the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth
of Hell”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is that all of them? You have lost the finest
brigade that ever left the shores of England!”</p>

<p>And to Captain Godfrey Morgan, now Viscount
Tredegar, who had led the 17th Lancers (thirty-four
returned out of one hundred and forty), the Duke
could only say, “My poor regiment! My poor
regiment!”</p>

<p>Sergeant Farrell and Private Malone, as was only
fitting, also received the Cross for Valour.</p>

<p>I have given the account of the brave deed of
Berryman and his companions at some length, because
it is, to my mind, one of the most signal acts of
devotion in the chronicles of the V.C. A very large
proportion of those who have won the Cross distinguished
themselves in the attempt, successful or
otherwise, to save life, and there is no act that is more
deserving of our fullest admiration. “Greater love
hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends.”</p>

<p>There were other lives saved in that death-stricken
valley that day besides Webb’s. Captain Morris, who
led a troop of the 17th Lancers, was taken prisoner
by the Russians after a desperate encounter, but
managed to escape in the confusion. Grievously
wounded and on foot, for his second horse had been
shot under him, he struggled towards the British lines,
until from sheer exhaustion he fell beside the dead
body of his brother-officer, Captain Nolan.</p>

<p>It is stated that the two officers, knowing the peril
that faced them, had each left in his friend’s charge a
letter to be sent home if he fell and the other survived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
These letters were found in the breasts of the two as
they lay side by side.</p>

<p>Captain Morris, however, was luckily still alive. To
his assistance promptly came Sergeant-Major Charles
Wooden of his own regiment, who pluckily stood by
his body until he saw a surgeon. The latter, who
proved to be Surgeon Mouat of the 6th Dragoon
Guards (now Sir James Mouat, K.C.B.), promptly went
over to the wounded man, and despite the heavy fire
that was being kept up, dressed his wounds as coolly
as if he had been in the operating-room. His skill
stopped the hemorrhage, which undoubtedly saved the
captain’s life, and for this, as well as for getting the
wounded man back to safety, the brave surgeon in due
course got his V.C. Sergeant-Major Wooden was
decorated at the same time.</p>

<p>One other man of the 17th Lancers who distinguished
himself in this historic charge was the
regimental butcher, John Veigh. Hearing that the
dash for the Russian guns was to be made, he left his
work in his bloodstained smock without seeking
permission, borrowed a sabre, and rode through the
valley with his comrades. “Butcher Jack” cut down
six gunners and returned unhurt, still smoking the
short black pipe which was in his mouth when he
joined in the ride.</p>

<p>The two remaining Balaclava Crosses were awarded
to Private Samuel Parkes, a Light Dragoon, and
Lieutenant Alexander Robert Dunn, of the 11th
Hussars.</p>

<p>Parkes’ exploit was a courageous rescue of Trumpet-Major
Crawford, who, on being thrown helpless to the
ground by his horse, was furiously attacked by a couple
of Cossacks. Himself unhorsed, he fearlessly bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
down upon the cowardly Russians, and plied his sword
with such vigour that he sent them flying. The two
were attacked again by a larger party of Cossacks, but
Parkes maintained such a sturdy defence that he was
only subdued when a shot struck his sabre out of his
hand. He and Crawford were made prisoners, and not
released until a year later.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dunn had the distinction of being the
only officer of the Light Brigade to win the V.C.
When Sergeant Bentley of his regiment fell behind in
the dash back to safety, and was quickly set on by
three Russians, the lieutenant turned his horse and
rode to his comrade’s aid. Dunn was a less powerful
man than Parkes, but he sabred two of the Cossack
lancers clean out of their saddles and put the third
to flight.</p>

<p>Subsequently Lieutenant Dunn rescued a private of
the Hussars from certain death in similar circumstances.
He survived the Crimean War and rose
to distinction in the service, but his career was cut short
all too soon by an accident in the Abyssinian
campaign.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRIMEA.&mdash;THE HEROES OF INKERMAN.</span></h2>

<p>The fierce battle on the plateau of Inkerman, in
the early morning of November 5th, 1854,
was the most desperate engagement of the whole
war. It has, indeed, been described as “the bloodiest
struggle ever witnessed since war cursed the earth.”
The sixty thousand Russians who made a sortie out
of Sebastopol were able through the heavy mists that
hung over the field to take the British force of eight
thousand men by surprise, and the fight at once became
a hand-to-hand encounter rather than a pitched battle.</p>

<p>To call Inkerman the “soldiers’ battle” is to give
our brave fellows who fought that day no more than
their due. There was scant time for any plan of
operations to be formed; as the guardsmen&mdash;Grenadiers,
Coldstreams, and Scots&mdash;turned out of
their tents at the warning bugle call it was to face
immediately an enemy already entrenched behind
battery and redoubt which belched forth shell and
grape-shot incessantly. With bayonets fixed they
went forward at the charge to silence those terrible
flame-mouthed cannon and drive the Russians from
battery and rifle-pit, and once among the foe British
pluck could be relied on to carry the day.</p>

<p>What deeds of daring were done in the mist-shrouded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
glades and dells of Inkerman, in the valley
and on the heights that commanded the British
position, can never be fully chronicled. We know,
however, how some of our gallant soldiers bore
themselves, for in that titanic struggle acts of signal
bravery were performed that were remembered afterwards
and deemed worthy of recognition.</p>

<p>Charles McDermond and Thomas Beach, privates,
made themselves conspicuous in saving the lives of
two officers who were lying on the ground wounded
and at the mercy of Russians, who never hesitated to
kill a disabled man. So, too, did Sergeant George
Walters of the 49th Regiment, who was more than
a match for half a dozen Russians when Brigadier-General
Adams got cut off. All three won their
V.C.’s that day.</p>

<p>Of Lieutenant Mark Walker, of the 30th
(Cambridgeshire) Regiment, a striking story is told.
From out of the fog his men saw a great mass of
Russians, two battalions strong, advancing towards
them. They were ordered to open fire, but their
rifles were wet and useless. Seeing this, Walker
called on his men to fix bayonets and follow him,
and, running forward, leaped over the low wall behind
which the regiment had been lying hidden.
This was enough for the 30th. With a wild cheer,
they followed his lead, and flinging themselves impetuously
against the enemy, a mere handful as they
were, they actually sent the greycoats flying.</p>

<p>For this dashing feat, which turned what must
have been an inevitable defeat into a victory, the
lieutenant was mentioned in despatches and awarded
the Cross. In after years he wrote himself General
Sir Mark Walker, K.C.B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was at the Sandbag Battery, whence the
Russians had directed a deadly fire upon our troops,
that perhaps the most brilliant feat of arms was
performed. The Sandbag had the distinction of being
fought for more than any other battery at Inkerman,
changing hands several times, until at last it was
held by the Grenadiers.</p>

<p>After the seventh fight round its parapet, the
Russians succeeded in driving back their besiegers,
and, exulting over their achievement, danced and sang
with joy. This exasperated the guardsmen to fresh
fury, and when Sir Charles Russell, their Captain,
called on his men to follow him, the Grenadiers,
followed by some Coldstreams and Fusiliers, sprang
forward to storm the position. This time they were
successful, driving the Russians before them.</p>

<p>How fierce was the contest will be understood
when I mention that the guardsmen’s ammunition
having run short, the men seized hold of stones and
rocks and hurled these at their foes. The Russians
responded in like manner until, as Sir Charles said
in a letter home to his mother, “the air was thick
with huge stones.”</p>

<p>Although the British were once more in the
Battery, the worst was not yet over. Many bold
Russians still hung on the parapet wall, or clung to
the embrasures, firing down on those inside. The
guardsmen, indeed, found that they were in a kind of
trap, and cries of “Charge them!” arose. Then a
soldier standing by Sir Charles Russell spoke up.</p>

<p>“If any officer will lead us, we will charge,” he said.</p>

<p>Up sprang Sir Charles, revolver in hand. “Come
on, my lads!” he cried. “Come on! Who will follow
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The first to respond to their gallant captain’s
call were Sergeant Norman and Privates Palmer and
Bailey. Into the face of the opposing Russians
the four dashed. Sir Charles’ revolver missed fire
the first time, but pulling the trigger again he
shot his man. At that moment a hand fell on his
shoulder and the private behind him said, “You
were nearly done for, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” answered the captain; “he was some
way from me.”</p>

<p>The soldier indicated another Russian who had
come up at Russell’s back. “His bayonet was all
but in you when I clouted him over the head,” he
said grimly.</p>

<p>Sir Charles saw how close he had been to death’s
door. “What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Anthony Palmer, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, if I live through this you shall not be
forgotten,” said Sir Charles; and he duly kept his
promise, Palmer being made a corporal the next
morning. He received the Victoria Cross for this
act later on, when the Order was instituted, his name
being among the first to be submitted.</p>

<p>Side by side Sir Charles Russell and Palmer (poor
Bailey had already been killed, and of Norman there
is no further mention) fought their way to a part of
the ledge on the right, where they joined a small
company of Grenadiers under Captain Burnaby. Here
the fight waged more fiercely than ever, Burnaby
especially distinguishing himself and winning the V.C.
time and time again, though he never received it.
The rush of the guardsmen was not to be withstood,
and the Russians were eventually forced back.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was awarded the V.C. for this exploit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
at the Sandbag Battery, receiving it at the hands of
his Queen in Hyde Park, three years later. He
might have treasured another souvenir of the fight,
also, in the shape of a long, black-stocked Russian
rifle, which he tore from the hands of a soldier and
kept until the end of the day.</p>

<p>Another officer of the Grenadiers who won similar
distinction at the Sandbag Battery was Lieutenant-Colonel
the Honourable Henry Percy (afterwards,
Lord Percy). A number of his men at one time
charged too far and became surrounded by the enemy.
To add to their peril, they were without ammunition.
Colonel Percy, coming to their assistance, successfully
extricated them from this dangerous position and led
them to where they could obtain cartridges. Just
before this he had charged alone into the battery,
only being repulsed by a great stone that struck him
senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>Other eyes than those of his own men were upon
him, the Duke of Cambridge himself noting the action
and having some warm words of commendation to say
afterwards.</p>

<p>There are one or two other Inkerman Crosses the
stories of which remain to be told.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Henry Hugh Clifford won the right to
add V.C. to his name by a deed of unusual daring.
While in charge of a company of the Rifle Brigade he
saw that a strong body of Russians was deploying to
take one of our regiments in the rear. Without
waiting to obtain an order to move from his position,
he called to his men to follow him, and charged boldly
into the midst of the Russians.</p>

<p>Clifford outdistanced his men by several yards,
being mounted while they were on foot, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
consequence was that he found himself alone in the
enemy’s ranks. The fierceness of his onslaught, and
the belief on the Russians’ part that a troop of cavalry
was behind him, gave him momentary advantage.
The enemy wavered, and the Rifle Brigade men coming
up at the charge, they soon after surrendered.</p>

<p>It was cut and thrust for Clifford while he was
engaged on all hands at once, but in the thick of
the fight he managed to save the life of a private in
addition to protecting his own.</p>

<p>The exploit of Lieutenant Miller of the Royal
Artillery bears some resemblance to the foregoing.
An advancing body of Russian infantry bore down
upon his gun battery when he was without any
support. One last round was fired, and then bidding
his men “Draw swords and charge!” he rode out
under the hail of bullets straight into the enemy’s
midst. The gunners followed to a man; some armed
with swords, others with ramrods, and one of them&mdash;a
famous boxer&mdash;relying only on his fists, with which
he was seen to lay many a Russian low!</p>

<p>The greycoats got possession of the guns, for desperately
as the artillerymen fought they could not stay
the enemy’s advance, but it is satisfactory to know
that the battery was retaken not long after and
fought again by Miller and his gallant men.</p>

<p>Yet another hard fight at the guns took place at a
battery where Sergeant-Major Henry was in charge.
When the Russians were upon them, he and a private
named Taylor drew their swords and made a desperate
defence. Taylor was soon slain, however, together
with nearly all the other gunners, and Henry badly
wounded. A bayonet pierced his chest, another pinned
him in the back, and he sank to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>As was their wont, the Russians continued to strike
at the helpless man as he lay at their mercy, the
result being that when some time later Henry was
rescued and found to be alive he had no fewer than
twelve terrible wounds! He lived, however, to wear
his Cross for Valour with his fellow-artilleryman,
Miller, and to rise to the rank of captain.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRIMEA.&mdash;WITH THE SAPPERS AND MINERS.&mdash;IN
TRENCH AND RIFLE-PIT.</span></h2>

<p>The battle of Inkerman was the last great battle
of the Crimean campaign fought round Sebastopol.
The rest of the story of the long siege is one that deals
with the heroic if unobtrusive work of the “sappers
and miners,” the Royal Engineers, those “handy men”
of the Army; with the tale of the trenches and rifle-pits,
wherein men carried their lives in their hands
night after night; with sudden sorties in the dead
of night or the mists of early dawn; and with
desperate attempts at storming the outworks of the
great Russian fortress, the Redan, the Mamelon Tower,
and the Malakoff.</p>

<p>Such a siege would have taxed to the utmost the
powers of any army, but when we remember how its
difficulties were added to by the severity of the
Russian winter and the hardships under which our
brave soldiers laboured through sickness and for the
want of clothing and other necessities of life, we must
account it a truly marvellous achievement.</p>

<p>Sir William Russell, who was the <cite>Times</cite> correspondent
in the war, fearlessly spoke his mind on the
scandalous mismanagement that prevailed, and from
his vivid letters we know how too often the stores ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out, how the hospital accommodation was insufficient,
and how but for the exertions of Florence Nightingale
and her band of devoted nurses we should have lost
far more than the 24,000 men who died from cholera
and other diseases, or were killed by the enemy’s bullets.</p>

<p>Of those days and nights in the trenches Lord
Wolseley can speak from experience, for as a young
engineering officer he saw some stirring service before
Sebastopol. The loss of his right eye, and a long
scar on his left cheek, bear witness to one thrilling
night’s work in an advance sap. He was out and
about again, however, as soon as possible, for every
man that could stand up was needed.</p>

<p>It is Lord Wolseley’s boast that, apart from the
time he spent in hospital, he was never absent from
the trenches at night except on one memorable
occasion. This was when he and a brother-officer
made a hasty Christmas pudding together, compounding
it in a hollowed-out shell, with a shot for pestle.
The “very bad suet” which they got from Balaclava,
or the fact that the pudding had to be devoured ere
it was half boiled, may be accounted sufficient
explanation for the young officer’s breakdown. “At
about twelve o’clock,” he says pathetically, “I thought
I was going to expire.”</p>

<p>In giving the record of the V.C. heroes who won
glory in the long months that elapsed between the
battle of Inkerman and the fall of Sebastopol, we
may well begin with the Royal Engineers, the popular
“Mudlarks,” whose proud mottoes are “Ubique” (everywhere)
and “Quo Fas et Gloria ducunt” (where right
and glory lead). Eight of the many Crosses to their
credit were gained in the Crimea. Let us see in
what manner these were won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>William J. Lendrim (or Lindrim, for his name is
found spelt both ways), Corporal No. 1078, R.E., had
three dates inscribed on his Cross, February 14th,
April 11th, and April 20th, 1855. On the first
occasion he was sent to do sapper’s work in a
battery that was held by a hundred and fifty French
Chasseurs. A hot fire from the Russian guns had
wrought dreadful havoc among the gabions and raked
the trenches, but Lendrim, assuming command of the
Frenchmen, quickly set to work to repair the damage.
With utter disregard for self, he was here, there, and
everywhere at once, replacing a gabion where it had
been struck down, digging in the trench and shovelling
up earth round the weak places. Lendrim’s
coolness and plucky example saved that battery from
demolition, as the French officer in charge of the
Chasseurs very properly noted in his report.</p>

<p>His second exploit was to mount the roof of a
powder magazine that had caught fire and, under
a perfect hail of bullets, extinguish the flames.
This was a danger to which batteries were particularly
liable, the live shells and fire-balls that dropped
among them soon setting the basket-work of the
embrasures and other inflammable parts in a blaze.
I shall have something more to say about the “heroes
of the live shell” before this chapter is ended.</p>

<p>The third date on our brave sapper’s Cross, April
20th, recalls a very daring feat on his part. Out
among the rifle-pits, in the open, some Russians had
erected a screen of brushwood, barrels, and sailcloth,
behind which they thought themselves well secure.
A party of British sappers who lay all night in a
trench thought otherwise. In the darkness, just
before dawn, a dozen of them, prominent among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
whom was Lendrim, dashed out and with bayonets
fixed charged the rifle-pits and destroyed the
screen.</p>

<p>We come now to the eventful 18th of June, in the
same year, when a desperate assault was made on the
Redan, the while the French stormed the
Malakoff, some distance to the right. With a column
of sailors and soldiers that formed one of the attacking
parties were Lieutenant Graham and Sapper
John Perie of his own corps. They had scaling-ladders
and sandbags with them, but these were not
wanted after all, for the terrific fire that poured
down on the open ground before the fortress walls
made it impossible for the work to go forward.</p>

<p>Even then men were found willing, nay anxious
to try, and scores of redcoats dotted the rocky
ground between the last trench and the abattis.
But it was a hopeless task&mdash;a wanton waste of
valuable lives. Very reluctantly Graham, who had
taken command, ordered his men to retire.</p>

<p>While, in the security of the trench, they waited
for the Russian fire to diminish, the lieutenant once
more showed of what stuff he was made. There was
a wounded sailor lying out in front, calling piteously
for help. An officer of the Naval Brigade heard
him first, and asked for another volunteer to assist in
bringing the wounded man in.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” cried Graham, springing up
instantly; “And I too,” added John Perie. And
out they ran on their noble errand of mercy, succeeding
in the task without being hit.</p>

<p>Both the lieutenant and the sapper were awarded
the Cross for their bravery. The former, as everyone
knows who has read the history of the Egyptian War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
became the famous General Sir Gerald Graham, the
victor of El Teb and Tamai. He died in 1899.</p>

<p>No reference to that disastrous assault on the
Redan would be complete without mention being
made of Colour-Sergeant Peter Leitch, V.C., also of
the Engineers. Like his fellow-sapper, Perie, he was
attached to a ladder-party which shared the fate of
defeat. At the foot of the fortress the little party
was held in check by the pitiless fire of shot and
shell. Men dropped on all sides, for there was no
cover.</p>

<p>There were the scaling-ladders to be placed,
however, and Leitch came forward to take the lead.
Leaping into the ditch, he pulled down gabion after
gabion from the enemy’s parapet until sufficient had
been secured to make a <i lang="fr">caponnière</i>, filling them with
earth and placing them to afford shelter to his
comrades. It was a heroic task, and many a wound
did he receive until he was finally disabled, but he
had the satisfaction of knowing that he had done his
duty well.</p>

<p>Nor does this conclude the record of the gallant
“Mudlarks.” I might tell a stirring story of how
Lieutenant Howard Crauford Elphinstone (afterwards
a Major-General and a K.C.B.) did great deeds in
that same affair of the Redan, rescuing with the party
of volunteers he led no fewer than twenty wounded
men, and winning the French Legion of Honour in
addition to the Cross for Valour. But I have only
room now to speak of one more, John Ross, Corporal
No. 997.</p>

<p>Of the three acts of gallantry of which the dates
are graven on his Cross, two were performed for
daring sapping operations in what were termed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
4th and 5th Parallels. In the darkness of night
he and his men worked like moles, quietly but
swiftly, connecting (in the first instance) the 4th
Parallel with a disused Russian rifle-pit, the line of
cover thus formed giving the attacking party a
tremendous advantage when morning broke and the
fight was renewed.</p>

<p>It was highly dangerous work from first to last.
Every few minutes shells and fire-balls from the
Russian guns, which kept up a constant cannonade
throughout the night, would fall in their midst, and
unless these were promptly extinguished the havoc
wrought was considerable. But through it all they
plied their spades bravely and set their earth-filled
gabions in position, Ross himself doing the greater
part of this latter hazardous work.</p>

<p>His third notable exploit bears date September
8th, of the same year, 1855. The last assault on
the Redan by the allied troops had been made, but
with what results was not known. Ominous loud
explosions startled the still night air every now and
then, and the British and French troops held back
uncertainly, waiting for the enemy’s next move.</p>

<p>The cessation of the Russian cannonade and
musketry fire, however, led many to think that the
greycoats had abandoned their position, even if only
temporarily. Among those of this way of thinking
was Corporal Ross. Leaving the trench of the 5th
Parallel, where he was working, he set off alone across
the intervening ground to see if his suspicions were
correct. It was ticklish work, he knew, for the
flashes of the explosions in the huge fortress lit up
the plain vividly, and his figure showed up an easy
mark for any Russian sharpshooter who remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
on the watch. But he kept on until he reached the
abattis, when clambering up to the nearest embrasure
he wormed his way in.</p>

<p>The place was empty. Only a dismantled gun
and the débris caused by a well-aimed shell greeted
his eyes. Having made certain that he had not been
deceived, Ross hastened back to the lines to spread
the news. A party was at once formed to make
another inspection of the Redan, Ross accompanying
it and leading the way into the fortress, which was
found absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>The Redan was forthwith occupied by our men,
but the siege was now practically over. The Russians
had retired to the north side of the harbour, evacuating
the town.</p>

<p>So much for the “Royal Sappers and Miners”; we
shall meet them later in a warmer clime, in India,
doing their duty as faithfully and performing deeds
every whit as heroic as any they did in the bleak
wastes of the Crimea.</p>

<p class="tb">The heroes of the trenches and rifle-pits appeal
especially to the imagination. The long vigil of
the sentries as they paced to and fro while their
comrades slept or worked in the trench at their back
was an ordeal well calculated to try the nerves of even
seasoned soldiers. A goodly proportion of the guardsmen,
riflemen, and others who were detailed for this
hazardous work were under fire in this campaign for
the first time in their lives, but we never read that
they flinched from the task imposed upon them.</p>

<p>However worn and weary the sentry might be,
after a long day of digging and hauling sandbags,
he knew he had to exert the utmost vigilance while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
on guard. Under cover of the darkness it was a
favourite pastime with the Russians to make sorties
in little parties of three and four from the fortress,
in the hope of surprising the harassed sappers as they
took a brief and well-earned rest.</p>

<p>So came three Russians one bitterly cold December
night in 1854 to a small outlying picket of the
7th Royal Fusiliers. Private Norman, on single
sentry-go, caught sight of the grey figures creeping
stealthily towards him. Firing his rifle to sound the
alarm, he rushed forward and leaped boldly into the
trench where the enemy had taken cover. Two he
seized and held prisoner, conducting them back to
the British lines, but the third escaped. The plucky
Fusilier got the Cross for this action when the time
came to reckon up those who were most worthy of
the honour.</p>

<p>But to narrate the several exploits of the heroes
of the trenches is to tell much the same story over
and over again. A score or more of gallant fellows&mdash;Moynihan,
Coleman, Alexander, McWheeney (who was
never absent for a single day from his duties throughout
the war), and others&mdash;braved the Russian fire
to dash out into the open and rescue from certain
death some wounded officer or private who lay exposed
on the field. The V.C. was often earned many
times over by these.</p>

<p>Only a few stand out from the rest by reason of
some special feature, such as Private John Prosser
of the 1st Regiment, who, seeing a rascally soldier
wearing the Queen’s scarlet in the act of deserting
to the Russian lines, jumped out of his trench and
chasing the fugitive under a heavy cross fire collared
him and brought him back to camp&mdash;and, let it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hoped, swift justice. For this, and for rescuing a
wounded comrade later on, Prosser gained his V.C.</p>

<p>There were, too, the “heroes of the live shell” to
whom I made reference some pages back. Sergeant
Ablett, of the Grenadiers, with Privates Strong,
Lyons, Coffey, McCorrie, and Wheatley, received the
decoration for this act of valour. Plump into the
trench in which each delved dropped a fizzing shell,
and without a moment’s hesitation the plucky fellow
lifted it up and flung it over the parapet, to burst
more or less harmlessly outside.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ablett’s shell fell right among some
ammunition cases and powder barrels, and but for his
prompt action a terrible explosion would have taken
place with much loss of life. In Wheatley’s case the
stalwart private attempted first to knock out the
burning fuse, but failing to do this he coolly dropped
his rifle and disposed of the unwelcome intruder with
his hands.</p>

<p>Of the dashing sorties upon the Russian rifle-pits
pages might be written. I have only space to tell
of one such. It may well serve as characteristic
of all. Privates Robert Humpston, Joseph Bradshaw,
and R. McGregor of the Rifle Brigade are my heroes.</p>

<p>Far out on the Woronzoff Road, near some
formidable quarries that had served the Russians
well, was a strongly protected rifle-pit whence sharpshooters
directed a deadly fire against a battery in
process of formation by our men. It was essential
that this “wasps’ nest” should be silenced.</p>

<p>Humpston particularly chafed over the seeming
impossibility of doing this, and at last proposed to
two comrades (Bradshaw and McGregor) that they
should “rush” the pit. The two agreed, being much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
enraged, it is said, by the recent sniping of a bandsman
who was a special favourite.</p>

<p>Accordingly, without asking for the leave which
they knew would be denied them, the three stole
out of camp one morning before daybreak, and crept
unobserved towards the death-dealing pit. When
within a few yards of it they gave a wild cheer and
charged straight at the surprised Russians.</p>

<p>It was bayonet work, stab and thrust wherever
a greycoat showed. How many they killed between
them is not recorded, but the rifle-pit was cleared
once for all and its destruction accomplished.</p>

<p>All three privates were awarded the Victoria Cross,
and Humpston, as the leader, received prompt
promotion, together with the sum of £5.</p>

<p class="tb">Before closing this chapter and passing on to tell
of the Crimean naval Crosses, I cannot refrain from
noting just two daring deeds that gained the V.C.
for two gallant gunners during the operations before
Sebastopol. They are written large in the annals
of the Order.</p>

<p>Gunner and Driver Arthur, of the Royal Artillery,
was in an advanced battery at an engagement near
the Quarries, when the 7th Fusiliers fighting near
by him ran out of ammunition. Arthur promptly
volunteered to supply them, and although he had to
cross repeatedly an open space on which a hot fire
was concentrated, he carried the ammunition stores
to the waiting men. But for his assistance the
Fusiliers must have had to abandon the position
they had captured.</p>

<p>Equally dashing was Captain Dixon’s defence of
his battery. The latter was wrecked by a shell which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bursting in the magazine, blew it up and destroyed
five guns, besides killing nearly all the gunners. It
was a great event for the Russians, who cheered and
danced with joy at the result of the shot.</p>

<p>But they counted without Dixon. The sixth gun
of the battery, although half buried in earth, was
still workable. With some help he got the gun into
position again, loaded and sent an answering shot
hurtling into the enemy’s battery, much to their
surprise and discomfiture.</p>

<p>And it is to Dixon’s lasting glory that he worked
that single piece until darkness ended the duel. The
chagrined enemy peppered him without cessation
throughout the rest of that day, but he bore a charmed
life. The artillery captain rose to be a Major-General
in after years, with C.B. after his name
besides the letters V.C., while France honoured him
by creating him a Knight of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRIMEAN CROSSES OF THE NAVY.</span></h2>

<p>The record of our Bluejackets afloat and ashore in
the Crimean War is one of which the senior
service has good reason to be proud. While the siege
of Sebastopol was in its early stages a British fleet
sailed up to the Baltic, but without achieving much
result, though a second expedition succeeded (in 1855)
in doing considerable damage to the fortress of
Sveaborg. At the same time another fleet harassed
the enemy in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
On land the Naval Brigade did yeoman service at
Inkerman, and in the protracted fighting around
Sebastopol.</p>

<p>“Handy Man Jack” has never missed an
opportunity of going ashore to have “some shooting
with them redcoats,” in our big and little wars. From
the days of Nelson, when they slung their 24- and
18-pounders on to Diamond Rock, to the recent Boer
War, he has proved himself a rare fighter, quite as
efficient with rifle and bayonet as his brother-in-arms.
And the way he handles his field-guns must be the
envy of the artillery.</p>

<p>In the history of the V.C. the Navy not only
figures very prominently but enjoys the proud distinction
of having the first Cross for Valour placed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
its credit. The senior winner of the decoration is
Rear-Admiral C. D. Lucas, R.N., and the scene of his
exploit was Bomarsund, in the Baltic.</p>

<p>While the bombardment of this port of the Äland
Islands, which are situated just off the coast of Finland,
was being carried on by our warships under Admiral
Napier’s command, a live shell suddenly dropped on
to the deck of H.M.S. <i>Hecla</i>. It was a moment of
frightful suspense for every one on board who watched
the grim messenger of death fizzing there within a
few yards of them. But there was one man on deck
who saw what to do.</p>

<p>Acting-mate Lucas, on duty near one of the guns,
promptly ran forward and with iron nerve picked up
the shell, dropping it instantly over the ship’s side.
The burning fuse sputtered out in the water, and the
shell sank harmlessly to the bottom.</p>

<p>Captain Hall, his commander, brought the plucky
deed under the notice of Admiral Napier, who, in
writing to the Admiralty about the young sailor’s
bravery, trusted that “their Lordships would mark
their sense of it by promoting him.” This recommendation
was acted upon, Lucas being at once
raised to the rank of lieutenant. When later on the
Victoria Cross was instituted the young officer’s name
figured duly in the <cite>Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>Two other sailors who gained the V.C. for similar
actions were Captain William Peel, the dashing leader
of the Naval Brigade, and Chief Gunner Israel
Harding of H.M.S. <i>Alexandra</i>, also a Crimean veteran.</p>

<p>Whole pages might be written about Captain Peel’s
exploits. All the time the naval men were engaged
with the troops round Sebastopol he was ever to the
fore, leading forlorn hopes and fighting shoulder to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
shoulder with his soldier comrades whenever
opportunity offered. At Inkerman, at the fierce
attack on the Sandbag Battery, he was in the thick
of it, and again at the Redan assault.</p>

<p>Peel loved danger for danger’s sake. There was
no risk that daunted him. At the attack on the
impregnable Shah Nujeef, at Lucknow, in the Indian
Mutiny, two years later, he led his gun detachment
right up to the loopholed walls, which were crowded
with rebel sharpshooters. He behaved, said Sir Colin
Campbell, “very much as if he had been laying the
<i>Shannon</i> alongside an enemy’s frigate.”</p>

<p>It was Peel who first demonstrated the practicability
of fighting with big guns in the skirmishing line.
“It is a truth, and not a jest,” he once wrote home,
“that in battle we are with the skirmishers.” The
way in which the sailors handled their great ship’s
cannon, 8-inch guns, 24-pounders, and the like, was
marvellous. A military officer, in a letter that was
written at the front, gives an interesting reminiscence
of the Naval Brigade. “Sometimes in these early
days of October 1854,” he says, “whilst our soldiery
were lying upon the ground, weary, languid, and silent,
there used to be heard a strange uproar of men
coming nearer and nearer. Soon the comers would
prove to be Peel of the <i>Diamond</i> with a number of
his sailors, all busy in dragging up to the front one of
the ship’s heavy guns.”</p>

<p>In a future chapter we shall meet again this
intrepid son of Sir Robert Peel, the great statesman,
winning glory and renown under Campbell and
Havelock. For the present I must confine myself to
his career in the Crimea.</p>

<p>The most notable of the three acts, the dates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which are inscribed on his Cross, was performed in
October 1854, at the Diamond Battery which some
of the Naval Brigade were holding. The battery
needing fresh ammunition, this had to be brought in
by volunteers, for the horses of the waggons refused
to approach the earthworks owing to the heavy
Russian fire.</p>

<p>Case by case it was carried in and stacked in its
place, and right into the midst of it all, like a bolt
from the blue, dropped a shell. Peel jumped for it
like a flash. One heave of his shoulders and away
went the “whistle-neck” to burst in impotent fury
several yards off&mdash;outside the battery’s parapet.</p>

<p>The second date on his Cross notes the affair at
the Sandbag Battery, where he joined the Grenadier
officers and helped to save the colours from capture.
On the third occasion when his bravery was commended
for recognition he headed a ladder-party in
that assault on the Redan in which Graham and
Perie won such distinction.</p>

<p>In this attack the gallant captain was badly
wounded in the head and arm, a misfortune which
was the means of gaining the V.C. for another brave
young sailor. From the beginning of the war
Midshipman Edward St. John Daniels had attached
himself to Captain Peel, acting as the latter’s
aide-de-camp at Inkerman. During the battle he
was a conspicuous figure, as, mounted on a pony, he
accompanied his leader about the field.</p>

<p>In the Redan assault he was still by Peel’s side,
and caught him as he fell on the glacis. Then,
heedless of the danger to which he was exposed,
he coolly set to work to bandage the wounded man,
tying a tourniquet on his arm, which is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
saved Peel’s life. This done, he got his chief to a
place of safety.</p>

<p>Daniels did another plucky action some months
earlier, when he volunteered to bring in ammunition
from a waggon that had broken down outside his
battery. The fact that the waggon became immediately
the target for a murderous fire from the
Russian guns weighed little with him. He brought
in the cartridges and powder without receiving a
scratch, and the battery cheered to a man as the
plucky little chap scrambled over the parapet with his
last armful.</p>

<p>Along with Peel and Daniels must be named that
popular idol William Nathan Wrighte Hewett, known
to his messmates as “Bully Hewett.” He was nearly
as picturesque a character as his commander.</p>

<p>At Sebastopol, the day following Balaclava fight,
Hewett (he was acting-mate at the time), fought a
great long-range Lancaster gun that had been hauled
up from his ship, H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>. The gun drew a
determined attack on its flank from a very large
force of Russians, and orders were sent to Hewett
by a military officer to spike the gun and abandon
his battery. The odds were too overwhelming.</p>

<p>In emphatic language the young sailor declared
that he’d take no orders from anyone but his own
captain, and was going to stick to his gun.</p>

<p>The other “Beagles” were quite of his opinion.
In quick time they knocked down a portion of the
parapet that prevented the huge Lancaster bearing
on the flank and slewed the piece round. Then,
loading and firing with sailorly smartness, they
poured such a hot fire into the advancing horde
of Russians that the latter beat a retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>They used the big gun with great advantage at
Inkerman, but the young mate’s splendid defence of
his battery was enough by itself to win him a well-deserved
V.C. Hewett died eighteen years ago, a
Vice-Admiral and a K.C.B.</p>

<p>A page or two back I mentioned Israel Harding,
chief gunner, as a third naval hero of the live shell.
It was many years after the Crimean War that his
opportunity came, but his exploit may well be noted
down here.</p>

<p>Harding was a gunner on board H.M.S. <i>Alexandra</i>,
when, in July 1882, Sir Beauchamp Seymour (afterwards
Lord Alcester) with his fleet bombarded
Alexandria. On the first day of the action (the
11th), a big 10-inch shell from an Egyptian battery
struck the ironclad and lodged on the main deck.
The alarm was raised, and at the cry “Live shell
above the hatchway!” Harding rushed up the
companion. There was luckily a tub of water handy,
and having wetted the fizzing fuse he dumped the
shell into the tub just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>As in Lucas’s case, promotion quickly followed with
the gunner, while the V.C. was soon after conferred
upon him. The shell, it may be of interest to note,
is now among the treasures of her Majesty the
Queen.</p>

<p>So many naval heroes call for attention that I
must hurry on to speak of Lucas’s comrades in the
Baltic who also won the coveted decoration.</p>

<p>There was Captain of the Mast George Ingouville,
serving in the <i>Arrogant</i>. On the 13th of July 1855,
the second cutter of his vessel got into difficulties
while the fleet was bombarding the town of Viborg.
A shell having exploded her magazine, she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
half swamped and began to drift quickly to shore.
Observing this, Ingouville dived off into the sea
and swam after the runaway. He was handicapped
with a wounded arm, but being a strong swimmer
he reached the cutter just as it neared a battery.
With the painter over his shoulder he struck out
again for the <i>Arrogant</i>, and towed his prize safely
under her lee.</p>

<p>At about the same time a gallant lieutenant
of Marines&mdash;now Lieut.-Col. George Dare Dowell,
R.M.A.&mdash;did much the same thing. When a rocket-boat
of the <i>Arrogant</i> was disabled he lowered the
quarter-boat of his ship the <i>Ruby</i>, and with three
volunteers rowed to the other’s aid. Dowell not
only succeeded in saving some of the <i>Arrogant</i> men,
but on a second journey recaptured the boat.</p>

<p>It was a lieutenant of the <i>Arrogant</i>, however,
who eclipsed both these deeds, brave as they were.
The exploit of John Bythesea and his ship’s stoker,
William Johnstone, on the Island of Wardo, reads
more like fiction than sober fact. This is the story
of it.</p>

<p>Early in August of 1854 Lieutenant Bythesea
learned from a reliable source that some highly
important despatches from the Tsar, intended for
the General in charge of the island, were expected
to arrive with a mail then due. At once he conceived
the daring idea of intercepting the despatch-carrier
and securing his valuable documents. His
superior officers thought the project a mad one when
he first broached it, but Bythesea would not be
gainsaid. The thing was worth trying, and he and
Johnstone (who had volunteered his services) were
the men to carry it through with success. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
end he had his way, though when the two plucky
fellows quitted the ship on their hazardous errand
their shipmates bade them good-bye with little
expectation of ever seeing them again.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the stoker had disguised themselves
very effectively in Russian clothes, and managed
to get to land safely. Here they learned from their
informant, a Swedish farmer, that the mail had not
yet arrived, but was expected at any hour. When
darkness fell, therefore, the two Englishmen found
a good hiding-place down by the shore, and commenced
their vigil.</p>

<p>This was the evening of the 9th of August. It
was not until the 12th that the long-awaited mail
came to land. For three whole days and nights they
had not ventured from their concealment, save once
or twice when the vigilance of Russian patrols had
forced them to take to a small boat and anchor
about half a mile off the coast.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th, Johnstone, who spoke
Swedish fluently, learned from the friendly farmer
that the mail had arrived, and was to be sent to the
fort that night. Great caution was to be observed,
the farmer added, as it was known to the Russians
that someone from the British fleet had landed. At
dark, therefore, the two took up their position at a
convenient spot and awaited the coming of the mail-bags.
In due course they heard the grating of a
boat’s keel on the beach. A few Russian words
of command were given, and then sounded the
tramp of feet on the road that led up to the military
station.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ESCORT CAME SWINGING UP THE ROAD WITHOUT A
SUSPICION OF DANGER.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_53">Page 53.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The lieutenant and his companion were ready at the
instant. A hasty glance at their weapons satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
them that these were in order, and moving a bit
nearer to the roadway they waited until the escort
approached.</p>

<p>In the dim light they perceived that the Russian
soldiers in charge of the bags numbered five. It was
heavy odds, but the prize was great. They could not
dream of drawing back. The escort came swinging
up the road without a suspicion of danger, and just
as they passed the spot where a clump of bushes
provided secure shelter out leapt the two Englishmen
with cutlass and revolver.</p>

<p>The cold steel did the work effectively; a pistol
shot would have raised the alarm. Three of the
soldiers were cut down in the surprise attack, while
the remaining two yielded themselves prisoners to
these redoubtable assailants. As quickly as possible
prisoners and mail-bags were hurried to the water’s
edge, where a boat lay in readiness for them.</p>

<p>In half an hour’s time the despatches were being
examined in the captain’s cabin on board the <i>Arrogant</i>,
their contents proving to be of the utmost importance.
Bythesea had captured the details of certain extensive
operations planned against the Baltic fleet of the Allies
and the army in the South. Such a service was
worthy of the highest honour, and both the lieutenant
and Stoker Johnstone received the Cross for Valour for
that desperate night’s work.</p>

<p class="tb">Down in the South, in the Sea of Azov, which the
map shows us to lie just north of the Black Sea, our
Bluejackets were doing splendid service in the latter
months of 1855. The towns of Genitchesk and
Taganrog were shelled with great loss to the Russians,
but as they moved their stores farther inland the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
occasion arose for individual expeditions which aimed
at destroying these. The story of the fleet’s operations
in this quarter, therefore, resolves itself into a relation
of the several attempts, successful and otherwise, to
harass the enemy in this way.</p>

<p>That the task of setting fire to the store buildings
was attended with tremendous risk was proved over
and over again. One or two daring spirits, including
a French captain, were caught and shot by Cossack
patrols. But there are always men to be found ready&mdash;nay,
anxious&mdash;to undertake enterprises of so
desperate a nature.</p>

<p>Wellington had the renowned scout, Major
Colquhoun Grant (whose adventures in the Peninsula
teem with romance), doing wonderful “intelligence”
work for him; and to come to more recent times, we
may call to mind Lord Kitchener’s daring journey
through the Soudan in 1884, disguised as an Arab,
for the purpose of learning what were the intentions
of the various tribes with regard to Egypt.</p>

<p>In the Crimea such men as Lieutenants Day,
Buckley, Burgoyne, and Commerell acted as the eyes
and ears of their commanders, and volunteered for
those little jobs that so infuriated the Russians when
the red glow in the midnight sky showed them where
stacks of forage and other stores blazed merrily.</p>

<p>Day’s V.C. was awarded him for a most valuable
piece of work. His ship was stationed off Genitchesk
(frequently spelt Genitchi), in the north-eastern corner
of the Crimea, and it was deemed necessary to
reconnoitre the enemy’s lines to ascertain the full
strength of the Russians. For this dangerous service
the young lieutenant volunteered.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one night he was landed alone on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Tongue, or Spit, of Arabat, at the spot he had chosen
whence to start. Cossacks, singly or in small
companies, policed the marshy wastes, but Day
wriggled his way between their posts and eventually
got close to the Russian gunboats. The dead silence
that prevailed misled him as to the numbers thereon,
and convinced that the vessels were deserted he
returned to report the facts to his captain.</p>

<p>The next day circumstances induced him to suppose
that he had been mistaken. He decided to make
a second journey without loss of time, and one night
very soon afterwards saw him again on the Spit.
Day soon discovered that large reinforcements had
arrived on the mainland, and at once made haste to
return to his ship.</p>

<p>The long detours he was now obliged to make,
to avoid contact with the Cossack sentries, led him
through quagmires and over sandy stretches that
severely tried his endurance. When he reached the
shore at last, well-nigh exhausted, nearly ten hours
had elapsed since his start, and it is not surprising
that, having heard shots fired, his comrades had
given him up for lost. He got back after a most
providential escape, however, and made his report.
But for his discoveries an attempt would certainly
have been made to seize the Russian boats, in which
case the result must have been disastrous.</p>

<p>Lieutenants Buckley and Burgoyne distinguished
themselves by landing near Genitchesk at night and
firing some immense supplies of stones. With the
seaman, Robarts, who accompanied them, they were
nearly cut off by Cossacks on their return, and only
a fierce fight enabled them to escape. All three won
the V.C. for this daring piece of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Commerell (afterwards Admiral Sir
J. E. Commerell, G.C.B.) performed a like action
later on the same year, which gained the V.C. for
him and one of his two companions, Quartermaster
Rickard.</p>

<p>Their objective was the Crimean shore of the
Putrid Sea, on the western side of the Spit of Arabat.
They accomplished their task successfully, setting fire
to 400 tons of Russian corn and forage, but were
chased by Cossacks for a long distance. In the
helter-skelter rush back for the boat, about three
miles away, the third man of the party, Able-Seaman
George Milestone, fell exhausted in a swamp, and but
for Commerell’s and Rickard’s herculean exertions
must have fallen a victim to the enemy.</p>

<p>Making what is popularly known as a “bandy-chair”,
by clasping each other’s wrists, the two officers
managed to carry their companion a considerable
distance. A party of Cossacks at this juncture had
nearly succeeded in cutting them off, but the sailors in
the boat now opened fire, while Commerell, dropping
his burden for a moment, brought down the leading
horseman by a bullet from his revolver. This fortunately
checked the Cossacks, who were only some
sixty yards away, and by dint of half carrying, half
dragging Milestone, the plucky lieutenant and quartermaster
eventually got him to the boat, and were soon
out of reach of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The foregoing deeds of derring-do worthily uphold
the finest traditions of the Royal Navy. How more
largely still was the “First Line” to write its name
in the annals of the Victoria Cross will be seen in
the succeeding pages.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PERSIA.&mdash;HOW THE SQUARE WAS BROKEN.</span></h2>

<p>Among our little wars of the last century that
with Persia must not be passed over here,
inasmuch as it was the means of three distinguished
British officers winning the V.C. These were
Captain John Wood, of the Bombay Native Infantry,
and Lieutenants A. T. Moore and J. G. Malcolmson,
of the Bombay Light Cavalry.</p>

<p>The war originated in the persistent ill-treatment
of British residents at Teheran, and in the insults
offered to our Minister at the Persian Court, Mr.
Murray. No apologies being forthcoming, diplomatic
relations were broken off early in 1856. In
November of the same year, after fruitless attempts
had been made to patch up the quarrel, Persia
revealed the reason for her hostility by violating her
treaty and capturing Herat, and war was declared.</p>

<p>Herat from time immemorial had been subject to
Afghanistan, and as, from its position on the high road
from India to Persia, it formed the key of Afghanistan,
it was long coveted by the Shah. He laid violent
hands upon it in 1838, but the British Government
made him withdraw. This second insolent defiance
of our warnings could not be borne with equanimity;
a force comprising two British and three native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
regiments was despatched from India to read the
Persian monarch a lesson. Sir James Outram commanded
the expedition. The capture of Bushire was
the first success scored by the British troops, and it
was in the attack on this coast town in the Persian
Gulf that Captain Wood gained his Cross.</p>

<p>At the head of a grenadier company Wood made
a rush for the fort. Persian soldiers were in force
behind the parapet, and a hot rifle-fire was poured
into the advancing infantry, but under the inspiration
of their leader they held bravely on. The captain
was the first to mount the wall, where his tall figure
instantly became a target for the enemy. A score
of rifles were levelled at him, and some six or seven
bullets found their mark in his body.</p>

<p>Badly wounded as he was, Wood jumped down into
the midst of the enemy, killing their leader and
striking terror into the hearts of the rest. This
desperate charge, completed by his men, who had
quickly swarmed up the parapet after him, carried
the day. The fort was surrendered with little more
opposition.</p>

<p>The feat of arms, however, which led to Lieutenants
Moore and Malcolmson being decorated, was of even
greater brilliancy. To Moore belongs the almost
unique distinction of having broken a square.</p>

<p>It was at Khoosh-ab that his act of heroism took
place. Near this village, some way inland behind
Bushire, the Persians were massed about eight
thousand strong. Outram’s little army had made
a successful advance into the interior and routed the
Persian troops with considerable loss on their side,
and was now making its way back to the coast.
Surprise attacks at night had been frequent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this was the first attempt to make a determined stand
against our troops.</p>

<p>It was by a singular irony of fate that in this war
we should have had to fight against soldiers trained
in the art of war by British officers. But so it was.
After Sir John Malcolm’s mission to Persia in 1810,
the Shah set to work to remodel his army among
other institutions, and British officers were borrowed
for the purpose of bringing it to a state of efficiency.
The soldiers who gave battle to our troops at
Khoosh-ab, therefore, on February 8th, 1857, were
not raw levies. But, for all that, when it came to a
pitched battle the Persians showed great pusillanimity.
At the charges of the Bengal Cavalry their horsemen
scattered like chaff before the wind.</p>

<p>Most of the infantry, too, fled when Forbes’
turbaned sowars of the 3rd Bengals and Poonah
Horse rode down upon them, as panic-stricken as the
cavalry. But there was one regiment that, to its
honour, stood firm. In proper square formation they
awaited the onset of the charge, the front rank kneeling
with fixed bayonets, and those behind firing in
volleys.</p>

<p>With his colonel by his side, Lieutenant Moore
led his troop of the Bengals when the order was
given to charge, but Forbes having been hit the
young officer found himself alone. He had doubtless
read of Arnold Winkelried’s brave deed at Sempach,
when “in arms the Austrian phalanx stood,” but
whether this was in his mind or not he resolved on
a bold course. He would “break the square.”</p>

<p>As he neared the front rank of gleaming steel,
above which, through the curls of smoke, appeared
the dark bearded faces of the Persians, Moore pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his charger’s head straight, drove in his spurs, and
leapt sheer on to the raised bayonets. The splendid
animal fell dead within the square, pinning its rider
beneath its body; but the lieutenant was up and on
his feet in an instant, while through the gap he had
made the sowars charged after him.</p>

<p>In his fall Moore had the misfortune to break his
sword, and he was now called on to defend himself
with but a few inches of steel and a revolver. Seeing
his predicament, the Persians closed round him, eager
to avenge their defeat on the man who had broken
their square. Against these odds he must inevitably
have gone under had not help been suddenly forthcoming.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, his brother-officer, Lieutenant
Malcolmson, saw his danger. Spurring his horse, he
dashed through the throng of Persians to his comrade’s
aid, laying a man low with each sweep of his
long sword. Then, bidding Moore grip a stirrup, he
clove a way free for both of them out of the press.
What is certainly a remarkable fact is that neither
of the two received so much as a scratch.</p>

<p>Malcolmson’s plucky rescue was noted for recognition
when the proper time came, and in due course
he and Moore received their V.C.’s together. The
former died a few years ago, but Moore is still with
us, a Major-General and a C.B.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;THE GALLANT NINE AT DELHI.</span></h2>

<p>The early part of the year 1857 saw the outburst
of the Indian Mutiny which was to startle the
world by its unparalleled horrors and shake to its
foundations our rule in India. Never before was a
mere handful of white men called upon to face such
a fearful ordeal as fell to the lot of the 38,000
soldiers who were sprinkled all over the North-West
Provinces, and the record of that splendid struggle for
mastery is one that thrills every Englishman’s heart
with pride.</p>

<p>There are pages in it that one would willingly blot
out, for from the outset some terrible blunders were
committed. Inaction, smothered in “the regulations,
Section XVII.,” allowed mutiny to rear its head unchecked
and gain strength, until the time had almost
passed when it could be stamped out. But if there
were cowards and worse among the old-school British
officers of that day, there were not wanting those who
knew how to cope with the peril. We are glad to
forget Hewitt and those who erred with him in the
memory of Lawrence, Nicholson, Edwardes, Chamberlain,
and the many other heroes who came to the
front.</p>

<p>In every great crisis such as that which shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
India in 1857 the occasion has always found the
man. The Sepoy revolt was the means of bringing
into prominence hundreds of men unsuspected of
either genius or heroism, and of giving them a high
niche in the temple of fame. Young subalterns
suddenly thrust into positions of command, with the
lives of women and children in their hands, displayed
extraordinary courage and resource, and the annals of
the Victoria Cross bear witness to the magnificent
spirit of devotion which animated every breast.</p>

<p>One hundred and eighty-two Crosses were awarded
for acts of valour performed in the Mutiny, the list of
recipients including officers of the highest, and privates
of the humblest, rank; doctors and civilians; men
and beardless boys. In the following pages I shall
describe some of the deeds which won the decoration
and which stand out from the rest as especially
notable, beginning with the historic episode of
“the Gallant Nine” at Delhi.</p>

<p class="tb">The Indian Mutiny was not in its inception the
revolution that some historians have averred it to be.
It was a military mutiny arising from more or less
real grievances of the sepoys, to which the affair of
the “greased” cartridges served as the last straw.
Moreover, it was confined to one Presidency, that
of Bengal, and it is incorrect to say that the conspiracy
was widespread and that a large number of native
princes and rajahs were at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact only two dynastic rulers&mdash;the
execrable Nana Sahib and the Ranee of Jhansi&mdash;lent
it their support. The majority of the native
princes, among them being the powerful Maharajah of
Pattiala, sided with the British from the first, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was their fidelity, with their well-trained troops, which
enabled us to keep the flag flying through that awful
time.</p>

<p>“There were sepoys on both sides of the entrenchments
at Lucknow,” says Dr. Fitchett in his <cite>Tale of
the Great Mutiny</cite>. “Counting camp followers, native
servants, etc., there were two black faces to every
white face under the British flag which fluttered so
proudly over the historic ridge at Delhi. The ‘protected’
Sikh chiefs kept British authority from
temporary collapse betwixt the Jumna and the Sutlej.
They formed what Sir Richard Temple calls ‘a political
breakwater,’ on which the fury of rebellious Hindustan
broke in vain.” Had the Mutiny indeed been a
<em>national</em> uprising, what chances would the 38,000
white soldiers have had against the millions of natives
who comprised India’s population?</p>

<p>It is important to bear all this in mind while
following the course of events which marked the
progress of revolt. We shall not then get such a
distorted picture of the whole as is too frequently
presented to us.</p>

<p>The Mutiny was a military one, as I have said.
It began prematurely in an outbreak at Barrackpore,
on March 29, 1857. Here a drunken fanatical
sepoy, named Mungul Pandy, shot two British
officers and set light to the “human powder magazine,”
which was all too ready to explode. On the 10th of
May following came the tragedy of Meerut, where
the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, the 11th and 20th
Regiments of Native Infantry rose and massacred
every European not in the British lines, and this
despite the presence there of a strong troop of horse
artillery and a regiment of rifles, 1000 strong!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>After the carnage at Meerut the mutinous sowars
poured out unchecked along the high road to Delhi,
to spread the news of their success and claim in the
old, enfeebled pantaloon Mogul king in that city a
political head to their revolt. Delhi received them
open-armed. There were no British troops there, by
special treaty, only a few Englishmen in charge of
the great magazine and its stores.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the 31st of May (a Sunday)
was the day fixed for the sepoy regiments in Bengal
to rise simultaneously. Unforeseen events had precipitated
the catastrophe by a few weeks. In Delhi,
which was a nest of treason and intrigue, arrangements
had been perfected for the outbreak there, one
of the first objects to be attained being the seizure of
its arsenal. Hither, then, the mutineers turned at
once after their triumphant entry.</p>

<p>The magazine of Delhi was a huge building standing
about six hundred yards from the main-guard of the
Cashmere Gate. Within its four walls were guns,
shells, powder, rifles, and stores of cartridges in vast
quantities, from which the mutineers had relied upon
arming themselves. And to defend this priceless
storehouse there was but a little band of nine Englishmen,
for the score or so of sepoys under their
command could not be depended on.</p>

<p>The Nine comprised Lieutenant George Willoughby,
Captains Forrest and Raynor, Sergeants Stuart and
Edwards, and four Conductors, Buckley, Shaw, Scully,
and Crowe. Willoughby was in charge, a quiet-mannered,
slow-speaking man, but possessed of that
moral courage which is perhaps the highest of human
attributes. When the shouting horde from Meerut
swarmed in and began to massacre every white person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they met, he called his assistants inside the courtyard
and locked the great gates. At all costs the magazine
must be saved from falling into the hands of the
mutineers.</p>

<p>There was not a man of the eight but shared
his leader’s determination. With set, grim faces
they went about their work, preparing for the attack
which must come sooner or later. There were ten
guns to be placed in position, several gates to be
bolted and barred, and, last of all, the mine to be
laid beneath the magazine. Help would surely come&mdash;come
along that very road down which the sowars
of the 3rd Bengal Cavalry had galloped with bloodstained
swords and tunics. But if it did not, the
Nine knew their duty and would not flinch from
doing it.</p>

<p>With all possible speed the front entrance and
other important vulnerable points were covered with
howitzers, loaded with grape-shot. Arms had been
served out to all, including the native employees,
but the latter only waited the opportunity to escape.
In the meantime Conductor Buckley saw to the
laying of the mine, connecting it with a long thin
line of powder that ran out to the centre of the
courtyard under a little lemon tree.</p>

<p>Conductor Scully begged for the honour of firing
the train when the fatal moment came, and obtained
his desire. A signal (the raising of a cap) was then
arranged to be given, at which he was to apply his
port-fire to the fuse.</p>

<p>All being at last in readiness, the Nine stood at
their several posts waiting for the enemy to make
the first move. They had not to wait long. Within
half an hour came an urgent messenger from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Palace bearing a written summons to Willoughby to
surrender the magazine. The Head of the Nine tore
up the paper and gave his answer.</p>

<p>Soon after appeared a body of sepoys, men of the
Palace Guard and of the revolted Meerut regiments,
with a rabble of city people.</p>

<p>“Open the gates!” they cried. “In the name of
the King of Delhi, open the gates!”</p>

<p>Getting the same curt refusal that had greeted
the previous summons, some went off for scaling-ladders,
and as they heard these being fixed against
the outer wall the Nine knew the moment for action
had come. The sepoy employees of the Arsenal
were in full flight now, but Willoughby let them go.
He had no shot to spare for them. So over the
walls they scrambled, like rats deserting a sinking
ship, to join their compatriots without.</p>

<p>As the last man of them disappeared the rush of
the mutineers began. Swarming up the ladders
they lined the walls, whence they fired upon the
brave group of defenders, while the more intrepid
among them leapt boldly down into the yard. The
rifles of the Nine rang out sharply; then at the
word “Fire!” the big guns poured their charges of
grape into the huddled mass of rebels.</p>

<p>By this time a gate had been burst open, and here
the 24-pounder was booming its grim defiance. The
sepoys hung back in check for some minutes before
the rain of shot. Behind them, however, was a
rapidly increasing crowd, filling the air with the
cry of faith&mdash;“Deen! Deen!” and calling on their
brothers in the front to kill, and kill quickly. At
this, though the ground was littered with dead, the
rushes became more daring and the yard began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fill with dusky forms, driving the Englishmen farther
back.</p>

<p>The end was very near now. The sepoys were
dangerously close to the guns, and Willoughby realised
that in a few moments he would have to give the
fatal signal. One last quick glance up the white
streak of road showed him no sign of approaching
aid. They were helpless&mdash;doomed!</p>

<p>Willoughby threw a last charge into the gun he
himself worked.</p>

<p>“One more round, men,” he said, “and then&mdash;we’ve
done.”</p>

<p>The big pieces thundered again in the face of the
dark crowd by the broken gate, and at the groups
along the wall. Then, dropping his fuse, Scully ran
swiftly to the lemon tree where the post of honour
was his.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Buckley should give
the signal at a word from Willoughby, but the brave
conductor was bowled over with a ball in his elbow.
It fell to Willoughby himself, therefore, to make the
sign. He raised his cap from his head, as if in
salute, and the same moment Scully bent down with
his port-fire over the powder train.</p>

<p>There was a flash of flame across the yard to the
door of the big store building, a brief instant of
suspense, and then, with a deafening roar which shook
Delhi from end to end, the great magazine blew up.</p>

<p>A dense column of smoke and débris shot high up
into the sky, which was lit with crimson glory by
the leaping flames. The smoke hung there for hours,
like a black pall over the city, a sign for all who
could read that the Huzoors, the Masters, had given
their first answer of defiance to Mutiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In that tremendous explosion close on a thousand
mutineers perished, crushed by the falling walls and
masonry. Of the devoted Nine five were never seen
again, among them being Conductor Scully. The
four survivors, Willoughby, Buckley, Forrest, and
Raynor, smoke-blackened and unrecognisable, escaped
into the country outside the walls, and set off for
Meerut, the nearest British cantonment.</p>

<p>Forrest and Buckley, both badly wounded, arrived
safely there with Raynor, to tell the story of their
deed; but Willoughby, who had separated from them,
was less fortunate. His companions learned of their
brave leader’s fate some time after, when a native
brought news of how some five British officers had
been waylaid and cut to pieces near Koomhera.
Willoughby formed one of the doomed party.</p>

<p>It was a sad ending to a fine career, and throughout
India and England the keenest regret was felt that
he had not lived to receive the V.C. with which, in
due course, each of his three comrades was decorated.</p>

<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;WITH SABRE AND GUN AGAINST SEPOY.</span></h2>

<p>The siege of Delhi, which was begun a month
after the rebellion had broken out, ranks with
the most historic sieges of modern times. In its
course it yielded many notable Crosses.</p>

<p>Defended by high bastions and walls of solid
masonry, the city proved a hard nut to crack, and
Generals Barnard and Wilson, who conducted the
operations with an army of British, Afghan, Sikh, and
Ghurka troops, spent several months before reducing
the stronghold. Even then its capture was only
made possible by the arrival of a siege train under
Brigadier-General John Nicholson.</p>

<p>To Nicholson belongs a great share of the credit for
the fall of Delhi. By a series of remarkable forced
marches he brought a strong force of artillery and
British and Sikh soldiers from the Punjab to the
Ridge at Delhi, which added greatly to the strength
of the army there encamped. And by his impetuosity
in council he compelled the wavering General Wilson
to decide on the final assault in September.</p>

<p>Before I come to this point, however, I have to
tell of some gallant deeds that were performed in the
fighting round Delhi. While the army lay on the
Ridge preparing for its leap upon the rebel city, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
number of engagements with the enemy took place.
These were mostly of a very desperate character, and
the individual deeds of some who distinguished
themselves therein were fittingly rewarded with the
Cross for Valour.</p>

<p>In one of the sorties made by the sepoys at Delhi
in July of that year, 1857, Lieutenant Hills and
Major Tombs, of the Bengal Horse Artillery, had a
fierce encounter with the rebels, which gained the V.C.
for each of them.</p>

<p>With a cavalry picket and two guns, Hills was on
outpost duty on the trunk road, near a piece of high
ground called the Mound, when a large body of sepoy
sowars from the city charged upon him. The picket,
taken by surprise, took to flight and left the guns
undefended, but Hills remained at his post. To save
his guns and give the gunners a chance of opening
fire was the plucky lieutenant’s first thought, so
clapping spurs to his horse he bore down alone on
the enemy.</p>

<p>In narrating the incident himself he says: “I
thought that by charging them I might make a
commotion, and give the guns time to load, so in I
went at the front rank, cut down the first fellow,
slashed the next across the face as hard as I could,
when two sowars charged me. Both their horses
crashed into mine at the same moment, and, of course,
both horse and myself were sent flying. We went
down at such a pace that I escaped the cuts made at
me, one of them giving my jacket an awful slice just
below the left arm&mdash;it only, however, cut the jacket.</p>

<p>“Well, I lay quite snug until all had passed over
me, and then got up and looked about for my sword.
I found it full ten yards off. I had hardly got hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it when these fellows returned, two on horseback.
The first I wounded, and dropped him from his horse.
The second charged me with his lance. I put it
aside, and caught him an awful gash on the head and
face. I thought I had killed him. Apparently
he must have clung to his horse, for he disappeared.
The wounded man then came up, but got his skull
split. Then came on the third man&mdash;a young, active
fellow.</p>

<p>“I found myself getting very weak from want of
breath, the fall from my horse having pumped me
considerably, and my cloak, somehow or other, had
got tightly fixed round my throat, and was actually
choking me. I went, however, at the fellow and cut
him on the shoulder, but some ‘kupra’ (cloth) on it
apparently turned the blow. He managed to seize
the hilt of my sword and twisted it out of my hand,
and then we had a hand-to-hand fight, I punching
his head with my fists, and he trying to cut me, but
I was too close to him.”</p>

<p>At this critical moment Hills slipped on the wet
ground and fell. He lay at the sowar’s mercy, and
nothing could have saved him from death had not
Major Tombs come within sight of the scene. The
major was some thirty yards away, and had only his
revolver and sword with him. There was no time to
be lost, so resting the former weapon on his arm he
took a quick steady aim and fired. The shot caught
the sepoy in the breast, and as his uplifted arm fell
limply to his side he tumbled dead to the ground.</p>

<p>Thanking Heaven that his aim had been true, Major
Tombs hastened to assist Hills to his feet and help
him back to camp. But as they stood together a
rebel sowar rode by with the lieutenant’s pistol in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
hand. In a moment Hills, who had regained his
sword, dashed after the man, who proved no mean
adversary.</p>

<p>They went at it cut and slash for some time; then
a smashing blow from the sowar’s tulwar broke down
the lieutenant’s guard and cut him on the head.
Tombs now received the sepoy’s attack, but the
major was among the best swordsmen in the army,
and closing with his opponent he speedily ran him
through.</p>

<p>Both the officers had had their fill of fighting for the
day, and fortunately, perhaps, for them, no more rebels
appeared to molest them on their return to the camp.
The lieutenant, I may note in passing, is now the
well-known Lieut.-General Sir J. Hills-Johnes, G.C.B.;
his fellow-hero of the fight died some years ago, a
Major-General and a K.C.B.</p>

<p>Another veteran of the Indian Mutiny still alive,
who also won his V.C. at Delhi, is Colonel Thomas
Cadell. A lieutenant in the Bengal European
Fusiliers at the time, Cadell figured in a hot affray
between a picket and an overwhelmingly large body
of rebels. In the face of a very severe fire he gallantly
went to the aid of a wounded bugler of his own regiment
and brought him safely in. On the same day,
hearing that another wounded man had been left
behind, he made a dash into the open, accompanied
by three men of his regiment, and succeeded in making
a second rescue.</p>

<p>The heroes of Delhi are so many that it is difficult
to choose among them. Place must be found,
however, for brief mention of the dashing exploit of
Colour-Sergeant Stephen Garvin of the 60th Rifles.
The Rifles, by the way, now the King’s Royal Rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Corps, have the goodly number of thirteen V.C.’s to
their credit.</p>

<p>In June 1857 the British army on the Ridge was
greatly harassed by rebel sharpshooters who took up
their position in a building known as the “Sammy
House.” It was essential that this hornet’s nest
should be destroyed, and volunteers were called for.
For this service Colour-Sergeant Garvin promptly
stepped forward and, with a small party of daring
spirits, set out on what looked to most like a forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>What the rebels thought of this impudent attempt
to oust them from their stronghold we cannot tell,
for but one or two of them escaped to the city with
their lives. Such an onslaught as they received at
the “Sammy House,” when Garvin and his valiant
dozen rushed the place, quite surpassed anything in
their experience. The colour-sergeant is described
as hewing and hacking like a paladin of romance, and
for his bravery and the example he set to his
followers he well deserved the Cross that later
adorned his breast.</p>

<p>At Bulandshahr, a little to the south of Delhi,
in September of the same year, there was a gallant
action fought by a body of the Bengal Horse Artillery,
which resulted in no fewer than seven V.C.’s being
awarded; but there is, I think, no more heroic act
recorded in the annals of this famous corps than that
of brave Gunner Connolly at Jhelum, two months
previously.</p>

<p>While working his gun early in the action he
was wounded in the left thigh, but he said nothing
about his wound, mounting his horse in the team
when the battery limbered up to another position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
After some hours’ hot work at this new post, Connolly
was again hit, and so badly that his superior officer
ordered him to the rear.</p>

<p>“I gave instructions for his removal out of action,”
says Lieutenant Cookes in his report, “but this brave
man, hearing the order, staggered to his feet and
said, ‘No, sir, I’ll not go there whilst I can work
here,’ and shortly afterwards he again resumed his
post as a spongeman.”</p>

<p>Throughout the fighting that day Connolly stuck to
his gun, though his wounds caused him great suffering
and loss of blood, and it was not until a third bullet
had ploughed its way through his leg that he gave
up. Then he was carried from the field unconscious.
That was the stuff that our gunners in India were
made of, and we may give Connolly and his fellows
our unstinted admiration. For sheer pluck and devotion
to duty they had no peers.</p>

<p>A highly distinguished artilleryman, who won his
Cross in a different way, was a young lieutenant
named Frederick Sleigh Roberts, now known to fame
as Field-Marshal Earl Roberts, K.G. The scene of
his valour was Khudaganj, near Fatehgarh, in the
Agra district, and the date the 2nd of January 1858.</p>

<p>Some five thousand rebels under the Nawab of
Farukhabad being in force in the neighbourhood, Sir
Colin Campbell pushed on with his troops to disperse
the enemy. Lieutenant Roberts was attached to Sir
Hope Grant’s staff, and with his leader came into
contact with the rebels at the village of Khudaganj.
Here a sharp engagement took place, which resulted
in the Nawab’s army being completely routed.</p>

<p>At the end of the fight, while the mounted men
were following up the fugitives, the young lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
saw a sowar of the Punjab Cavalry (a loyal native
regiment) in danger of being worsted by a sepoy armed
with fixed bayonet. Wheeling his horse in their
direction, he quickly thrust himself between the two
and, with a terrific sweep of his sword across the
other’s face, laid the sepoy low. A minute or two
later he caught sight of a couple of rebels making off
with a standard. Roberts determined that this should
be captured, so setting spurs to his horse he galloped
after them.</p>

<p>He overtook the pair just as they were about to
seek refuge in a village close by, and engaged them
both at once. The one who clutched the standard
he cut down, wrenching the trophy out of the other’s
hands, but the second sepoy, ere he could turn, placed
his musket close to the young officer’s body and pulled
the trigger. Fortunately for him, the musket missed
fire (it was in the days of the old percussion caps),
whereupon the sepoy made off, leaving Roberts to
return in triumph.</p>

<p>In other engagements like those at Bulandshahr and
Khudaganj many young cavalry officers who came to
high honour in later years distinguished themselves by
personal bravery. Prominent among these were
Captain Dighton Probyn and Lieutenant John Watson,
both of the Punjab Cavalry. Their exploits are well
worth narrating.</p>

<p>At the battle of Agra Probyn at the head of his
squadron charged a body of rebel infantry, and in the
mêlée became separated from his men. Beset as he
was by a crowd of sepoys, he cut his way through them
and engaged in a series of single combats of an Homeric
kind. In one instance he rode down upon a cluster
of sepoys, singled out the standard-bearer, killed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on the spot, and dashed off again with the colours.
His gallantry on this and other occasions was, as Sir
Hope Grant said in his despatch, so marked that he
was promptly awarded the V.C.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Watson had a similar heroic encounter
with a rebel on November 14th, 1857, when just
outside Lucknow he and his troop of Punjabis came
into contact with a force of rebel cavalry which far
outnumbered them.</p>

<p>As they approached the Ressaldar in command of
the rebels rode out in advance of his men with half
a dozen followers. He is described as having been “a
fine specimen of the Hindustani Mussulman,” a stalwart,
black-bearded, fierce-looking man. Here was a foeman
worthy of one’s steel. With all the daring that had
already made him beloved by his sowars and feared by
the enemy, Watson accepted the challenge thus offered,
and rode out to give the other combat.</p>

<p>He had got within a yard or so of his opponent
when the Ressaldar fired his pistol point blank at him,
but luckily the shot failed to take effect. It can only
be supposed that the bullet had fallen out in the
process of loading, for the two were too close together
for the rebel leader to have missed his mark. Without
hesitating, the lieutenant charged and dismounted the
other, who drew his tulwar and called his followers to
his aid.</p>

<p>Watson now found himself engaged with seven
opponents, and against their onslaught he had to
defend himself like a lion. It is not recorded that he
slew the Ressaldar, though it is to be hoped that he
did so, but he succeeded in keeping them all at bay
until his own sowars came to the rescue with some of
Probyn’s Horse who had witnessed the combat. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
when the rebels were put to flight the brave lieutenant’s
wounds bore evidence of the fierce nature of the combat.
A hideous slash on the head, a cut on the left arm,
another on the right arm that disabled that limb for
some time afterwards, and a sabre cut on the leg which
came near to permanently laming him, were the chief
hurts he had received, while a bullet hole in his coat
showed how nearly a shot had found him.</p>

<p>There were many tight corners that the young
cavalry leader found himself in before the Mutiny
came to an end, and despatches recorded his name
more than once for distinguished services, but if you
were to ask General Sir John Watson (he is a G.C.B.
now, like his brother-officer, Sir Dighton Probyn)
to-day, I doubt if he could remember another fight
that was so desperate as that hand-to-hand combat
with the mighty Ressaldar.</p>

<p>And if it should ever come to fade from his memory
he has only to look at a little bronze Maltese cross which
hangs among his other medals on his breast, to remind
himself of a time when it was touch-and-go with
death.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;THE BLOWING UP OF THE CASHMERE GATE.</span></h2>

<p>The final assault of Delhi, the leap of a little army
of five thousand British and native soldiers upon
a strongly fortified city held by fifty thousand rebels,
forms one of the most exciting chapters in the history
of the Indian Mutiny, and the blowing up of the
Cashmere Gate one of its most heroic incidents. Once
more did the gallant “sappers and miners,” whom we
last saw doing noble work in the trenches at Sebastopol,
here show themselves ready to face any peril at duty’s
call.</p>

<p>The decision to make the attack was come to at
that historic council on September 6th, 1857, to which
Nicholson went fully prepared to propose that General
Wilson should be superseded did he hesitate longer.
On the following day the engineers under Baird-Smith
and his able lieutenants set to work to construct the
trenching batteries, and by the 13th enough had been
done to warrant the assault.</p>

<p>We have a very vivid picture drawn for us by
several writers of how, on the night of the 13th, four
Engineer subalterns stole out of the camp on the
Ridge and crept cautiously up to the walls of the
enemy’s bastions to see what condition they were in.
Greathed, Home, Medley, and Lang were the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the four; one of them, Lieutenant Home, was to
earn undying fame the next day at the Cashmere
Gate.</p>

<p>Armed with swords and revolvers, the party&mdash;divided
into two sections&mdash;slipped into the great
ditch, sixteen feet deep, and made for the top of the
breach. But quiet as they were, the sepoy sentries
on the wall above had heard them. Men were heard
running from point to point. “They conversed in a
low tone,” writes Medley, who was with Lang under
the Cashmere Bastion, “and presently we heard the
ring of their steel ramrods as they loaded.”</p>

<p>Huddled into the darkest corner of the ditch, the
two officers waited anxiously for the sepoys to go
away, when another attempt might be made; but
the alarmed sentries held their ground. The engineers,
however, had seen that the breach was a good one,
“the slope being easy of ascent and no guns on the
flank,” so the four of them jumped up and made
a bolt for home. Directly they were discovered a
volley rattled out from behind them, and the whizzing
of balls about their ears quickened their steps over the
rough ground. Luckily not one was hit.</p>

<p>There was one other man engaged in reconnoitring
work that same night of whom little mention is made
in accounts of the siege. This was Bugler William
Sutton, of the 60th Rifles, a very brave fellow, as
had been proved some weeks previously during a
sortie from Delhi. On this occasion he dashed out
from cover and threw himself upon the sepoy bugler
who was about to sound the “advance” for the rebels.
The call never rang out, for Bugler Sutton’s aim was
quick and true, and the rebels, in some disorder, were
driven back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Volunteering for the dangerous service on which
the four engineers above-named had undertaken,
Sutton ventured forth alone to spy out the breach
at which his regiment was to be hurled next morning,
and succeeded in obtaining some very valuable information
for his superiors. The 60th Rifles gained
no fewer than eight Victoria Crosses during the
Mutiny, and one of them fell to Bugler Sutton, who
was elected unanimously for the honour by his
comrades.</p>

<p>But it is of the Cashmere Gate and what was done
there that this chapter is mainly to tell. According to
the plans of the council, four columns were to make
the attack simultaneously at four different points
in the walls. The one under Nicholson was to carry
the breach near the Cashmere Bastion, while another
column, under Colonel Campbell, was to blow up the
Cashmere Gate and force its entrance through into
the city. The duty of performing the first part of
this operation fell to Lieutenants Home and Salkeld
of the Engineers.</p>

<p>There was a little delay on the morning of the
assault, for it was found that the sepoys had been
hard at it in the night blocking up the holes in
the breaches with sandbags, and otherwise repairing
the damage done by our batteries. But at last everything
was in readiness. The signal to advance was
given, and the columns moved eagerly forward.</p>

<p>At the head of the third column (Campbell’s),
well in front of the rest, ran Home, Salkeld, two
sergeants, also of the Bengal Engineers,&mdash;let their
names be given, Smith and Carmichael,&mdash;Corporal
Burgess, and Bugler Hawthorne of the 52nd Regiment,
together with Havildar Pelluck Singh and eight sappers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Salkeld had a slow match in his hand (not a port-fire,
as is often stated); the sergeants and the other men
each carried a 25 lb. bag of powder. Behind, to
cover them, followed close a small firing party.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to conjure up the scene before
our eyes. As the little company nears the Gate it
sees that the bridge which formerly spanned the
ditch has been broken down. Only a single beam
stretches across. Nothing daunted, Lieutenant Home
leads the way, stepping lightly over the shaking beam
and dropping his powder bag at the foot of the Gate
ere he leaps down into the ditch.</p>

<p>Peering through the wicket, the sepoys stare in
sheer astonishment at this handful of mad Englishmen
charging at them, and four or five of the party have
got safely across, each depositing his precious bag
in its place, ere the rebel muskets speak out. Then
the slender wooden beam becomes indeed a bridge of
death. A sheet of flame flashes from the wicket of
the Gate, and one man after another falls, wounded
or killed outright. Enough bags, however, have been
flung down into position, and Home calls upon Salkeld
to finish the job.</p>

<p>With Sergeants Smith and Carmichael, and the
corporal by his side, Salkeld, who has been in waiting,
dashes for the frail bridge. He gains it and is over,
as a volley rattles out from the Gate, but before he
can light the fuse he falls, shot through leg and
arm.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Burgess!” he cries, holding out the
slow match. “Quick, man!”</p>

<p>The corporal takes the slow match in turn and bends
low over the powder, only to fall back the next instant
mortally wounded. We have it on Lord Roberts’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
authority that Burgess actually succeeded in lighting
the fuse, but opinions are at variance on this point.
It seems probable, however, that he did perform
his task, for when Sergeant Smith, seizing the slow
match in his turn, now goes forward to ignite the
powder, he sees that the fuse is fizzling.</p>

<p>A leap into the ditch, where he lands beside Home
and Bugler Hawthorne, saves him just in time. A
moment later and there is a loud explosion, a cloud
of smoke, and stones, pieces of wood, and other débris
raining down all around. In the noise of the firing
and the confusion that prevails, the bugler is meanwhile
sounding the “advance,” not once but thrice,
though it is extremely doubtful if it is heard
at all.</p>

<p>Colonel Campbell has seen the explosion, however,
and the storming party, straining like hounds in leash,
are no more to be held back. With a wild cheer
they spring forward, to find&mdash;not the big Gate itself
destroyed, but the little wicket, which was all that
had been blown in. One by one they creep through,
stepping over the scorched bodies of the sepoy
wardens within, and form up in the open space by
Skinner’s Church, where all are to meet.</p>

<p>But what of the survivors of the explosion left
behind in the ditch? Home is alive, and so are
Hawthorne, Smith, Burgess, and Salkeld, though the
two last are grievously wounded. Carmichael and
several others lie still for ever on the damp
ground.</p>

<p>With some assistance, brave John Smith and Bugler
Hawthorne get Lieutenant Salkeld into the doctor’s
hands, though it is evident nothing can be done for
him. Burgess, too, has a mortal wound, and he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
dead before friendly hands have carried him a score
of yards. Of the wounded only the havildar, who
had fallen with Carmichael before the deadly rain
of bullets, has any hope of recovery.</p>

<p class="tb">There is not much more to be said. Lieutenant
Philip Salkeld died a few days later, but not before
he knew that the Cross for Valour had been conferred
upon him. Sergeant Smith and the bugler were the
only two destined to wear the coveted decoration in
memory of that day’s desperate deed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Duncan Home figures in the list of
V.C. heroes with his brother-lieutenant by reason
of the Cross having been provisionally bestowed
upon him by General Wilson. His end, which came
scarcely three weeks later, was a dramatic one.</p>

<p>In the attack on Fort Malagarh it was expedient to
lay a mine and make a breach in the wall. Home
superintended this operation, and lit the slow match
himself. The fuse appearing to have gone out, he
went forward to examine it and relight it if necessary,
but at the moment he stooped the light reached the
powder and the mine blew up.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;THE STORY OF KOLAPORE KERR.</span></h2>

<p>The scene of the incident which I am about to
narrate was Kolapore (or Kolhapur, as the
modern spelling has it), an important town in the
Bombay Presidency. Even before the Mutiny broke
out there had been no little disaffection among the
people in that quarter of India, and when the news
of the revolt at Meerut and Delhi reached the
Presidency grave fears were entertained lest the
native troops there should join the rebels.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of most English officers attached
to native regiments in those days that they firmly
believed in the loyalty of their men. Only at the
last moment, when the soldiers they had drilled and
taught broke into open mutiny, could they grasp the
truth, and then it was often too late. But in Bombay
there was one officer whose trust was not belied.
This was Lieutenant William Alexander Kerr, of the
Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse.</p>

<p>“I know my men,” he would say, when the question
of loyalty was raised, “and I know they are true.
I’ll answer for <em>my</em> troopers at any time.”</p>

<p>Rather short men were these Mahrattas, but
sturdy, stocky fellows with somewhat flat features,
long jet black hair, and bronze faces, out of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
small fiery black eyes gleamed at one. They were
excellent fighters, as many a hill fight had proved,
and there were not a few officers in India who would as
soon have had a company of wild Mahratta warriors at
their back as Sikhs or Punjabis, when it came to a
tussle.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kerr certainly held this opinion. Long
service with them had made him acquainted with
their courage and faithfulness.</p>

<p>“The Bombay Infantry may rise, but not my
Mahrattas,” he affirmed. “There isn’t a man among
them who wouldn’t follow me to the ends of the
earth!”</p>

<p>He was stating this fact for the hundredth time at
a memorable council that was held in the officers’
mess at Satara on the night of July 8th, 1857, when
the startling news was flashed over the wires that
the 27th Bombay Native Infantry had revolted at
Kolapore. The message ran that nearly all their
English officers had been killed, only a few escaping
to find uncertain refuge in the Residency. Help
was needed urgently.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The officer commanding at
Satara faced his staff with a grave face. Here was
confirmation of their worst fears. The looks that
met his were full of foreboding; all, that is, save
Kerr’s.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, the young lieutenant turned
quickly to his superior.</p>

<p>“Give me leave, sir,” he said, “and I’ll undertake
with a company of our sowars to clear every mutineer
out of Kolapore.”</p>

<p>It was the chance he longed for, the chance to
prove the loyalty of his troopers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The colonel pondered some moments, for the little
force at Satara was not over strong.</p>

<p>“I can give you fifty men,” he said at last; “a
troop of fifty, no more. Can you manage with
that?”</p>

<p>“I can and I will,” answered Kerr tersely. And
half an hour later saw him spurring fast southward
with his Mahrattas behind him, in all the glory of
their gold-braided green coats and scarlet turbans.</p>

<p>Kolapore lay seventy-five miles due south, as the
crow flies, but their way led through unfrequented
roads and jungle paths, with swollen rivers and flooded
nullahs to swim across, for the rains had been heavy
of late and the fords were gone. Swamps impeded
their progress, clutching at the feet of the wiry hill
horses to drag them down, but they were clear at last,
and galloped breathless into Kolapore in rather less
than six-and-twenty hours from their start.</p>

<p>The mutineers of the revolted 27th Regiment had
entrenched themselves in a strongly built stone fort
on the outskirts of the town. The main entrance to
this was a massive wooden door which would need to
be forced open, for inside there were heavy bolts and
bars to secure it. So Kerr, choosing the quickest way,
borrowed a couple of antique cannon from the Rajah
of the place and pounded away to break the outer
wall; but the guns turned out to be worthless and
had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>There now remained the door to be broken open.
That offered the best, indeed the only, means of effecting
an entrance. Night was fast drawing nigh, and
the lieutenant was determined to take action at
once. It would not do to give the rebels breathing
space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Halting his Mahrattas some distance from the fort,
Kerr picked seventeen of his most trusted men and
bade them dismount and follow him to the attack.
For himself and a trooper whose name, strangely
enough, was Gumpunt Rao Deo Ker, he had obtained
two stout iron crowbars with which to force open
the door, and at a signal from him the little party
dashed eagerly forward.</p>

<p>From their loopholes and from the top of the wall
the sepoys poured an irregular fire upon the besiegers
below. But Kerr and Gumpunt Rao, working away
desperately with their bars, very soon made a hole
in the door near the ground. A few more blows
enlarged it sufficiently to allow one man to crawl
through on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>That was enough for Kerr.</p>

<p>“In we go, men,” he cried; “after me! Have your
swords ready!” And the little fierce-eyed men grinned
with delight as they saw their leader wriggle like a
snake through the hole with the faithful Gumpunt at
his heels. What a fight there was going to be!</p>

<p>They guessed truly. The instant Kerr showed
himself inside the courtyard he was greeted with a
volley of musketry, but the sepoys aimed too high,
and every bullet crashed harmlessly into the woodwork
over his head. Springing to his feet, the lieutenant
made a rush at his assailants that sent them flying
before him. And then, the scarlet turbans having
followed safely through the aperture one after another,
the mutineers were slowly driven back, leaving several
heaps of dead and wounded in their wake.</p>

<p>The fighting blood of the wild Mahrattas was up
now. A battalion of rebels could not have stayed
them. Before their fierce onslaught the mutineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fled to the refuge of a house that covered the second
entrance to the fort, but the building was set on fire,
and off they scampered again for dear life, though a
few perished in the flames.</p>

<p>Their next retreat was behind a gateway which led
to the inner portion of the fort. Here the shaken
remnant was joined by the men of the garrison, who
had been spectators of the affray. This reinforcement
gave them renewed confidence, and they opened a fresh
fire upon Kerr and his little band. The Mahrattas
needed no call from their valiant leader. Two or
three of them bit the dust under the hail of bullets,
but the rest leapt to the gate where Lieutenant Kerr
was already at work with his crowbar. Again a hole
was made, and again the plucky officer&mdash;always first&mdash;crept
through with his followers.</p>

<p>In the terrible hand-to-hand fight that ensued
within Kerr had the chain of his helmet cut by a
bullet, while another ball struck his sword. A sepoy,
too, thrust his musket almost into the lieutenant’s
face, the discharge blinding him for an instant, but
Kerr ran his sword through the man’s body ere he
could reload.</p>

<p>The thrust was a mighty one, and the effort to
withdraw his weapon was so great that it gave time
for a watching rebel to deal him a stunning blow on
the head with the butt end of a musket. Down
went Kerr like a felled log, and but for Gumpunt
Rao he would have been shot where he lay. Just in
the nick of time the Mahratta sprang between them
and sent the sepoy to his last account.</p>

<p>Kerr’s storming party was sadly reduced in
numbers by this time, and of those who had survived
not one had escaped being wounded. But as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as their leader had come to his senses, they went
forward once more, cutting down the mutineers with
their keen-edged curved swords, and striking terror
into the hearts of those who yet again fled before
them.</p>

<p>In their extremity the rebels made for an empty
disused temple, hastily barricading its door with
stones and anything that would help to keep those
dreaded greencoats at a safe distance. They still
had a good supply of cartridges left, and with these
did such execution that several more of the Mahratta
warriors were laid low.</p>

<p>But they had to reckon with a man who was bent
on teaching them such a lesson as they and every
mutineer in the Presidency should never forget.
Seven sowars alone were left to Kerr for his last
attack, seven out of the chosen seventeen who had
followed him through that first hole in the outer
door. Yet he did not wait to be reinforced. With
this mere handful of men he flung himself on the
temple door, which at once rang under the quick
blows of his iron bar.</p>

<p>The entrance to the building, however, was made
of stouter material than the other doors had been.
Neither he nor Gumpunt Rao could burst through
the wood. The lieutenant glanced round for another
weapon, and now to his delight saw a heap of hay
lying by a side wall. Here was the very thing
he wanted.</p>

<p>“Quick, Gumpunt!” he shouted. “Bring that hay
over here. We’ll burn the door down an’ finish
’em!”</p>

<p>And finish them they did. As the flames crackled
up and the door fell in, Kerr, Gumpunt Rao, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
other six leapt inside. A grim-looking band they
must have appeared, with their smoke-blackened
faces, their slashed and bloodstained tunics, and
doubly so to the panic-stricken mutineers who
cowered in the dark corners of the temple.</p>

<p>“No quarter!” the wild Mahrattas had begged of
their “sahib,” while they waited for the fire to do its
work. “Death to every rat caught in the hole!”
But Kerr would not grant them their wish. All who
would yield were to be taken prisoners; he had a
different fate in store for them.</p>

<p>So when the eight emerged again from the now
silent building, more bloodstained than ever, for a
few of the rats at bay had shown their teeth, they
brought with them a bare dozen of trembling sepoys,
all that remained of the mutinous garrison of Kolapore
Fort. And with these in their midst the little
swarthy hill-men in the green coats some hours later
rode triumphantly back to Satara, with Kerr at their
head, to tell of that grim night’s work.</p>

<p>The sparks of mutiny that might so easily have
burst into a flame in Bombay may be said to have
been stamped out by Lieutenant Kerr’s prompt and
vigorous action. Subsequent attempts were made to
create a rising, but they were fitful and half-hearted.
The lesson of Kolapore had been a stern one.</p>

<p>For his dashing exploit Lieutenant Kerr received
the V.C., a decoration which, I am glad to say, he is
still alive to wear. The brave Mahratta, Gumpunt
Rao Deo Ker, though he deserved to share the same
honour, was rewarded in a different fashion.</p>

<p>That is the story of Kolapore Kerr. It is, to my
mind, a theme every whit as inspiring to a poet’s pen
as the stand of the Guides at Cabul or Gillespie’s ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to “false Vellore.” Perhaps some day a poet will
arise who will commemorate for us in stirring verse
Kerr’s gallant deed, and tell how once and for all
the Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse proved their
loyalty to the British Raj.</p>

<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;THE DEFENCE OF THE DHOOLIES.</span></h2>

<p>In the preceding chapters I have told of many
heroes who have won imperishable glory at the
cannon’s mouth, “i’ the imminent deadly breach”;
at the head of charging squadrons; or in Homeric
personal combat. Valiant men were they all, and
worthy of high admiration; but I come now to speak
of other brave men, whose deeds though less ostentatious
should appeal to our imagination no less forcibly&mdash;the
devoted surgeons of our Army.</p>

<p>In the bead-roll of Britain’s heroes there are no more
honoured names than theirs, and very high up among
them I would place those of Surgeons Jee, McMaster,
Home, and Bradshaw. Their work was not to lead
storming parties or join in the press of battle, but
to follow in the wake of the fight, to relieve the
sufferings of the wounded, to bind up shattered limbs
and bandage the ghastly hurts that round-shot, sabre,
and musket had inflicted in the swirl of evil human
passions thus let loose.</p>

<p>It was work that demanded devotion and courage
of the highest order, for it was carried on mostly
under fire, when bullets rained pitilessly around, and
the very hand that one moment eased a sufferer’s
pain might the next itself be stilled in death. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the tale of what was done in Lucknow streets on that
historic September day in 1857 when Havelock and
Outram fought their way into the besieged city, testify
to the pluck and noble self-sacrifice of which our
Army doctors are capable at duty’s call.</p>

<p>Surgeon Joseph Jee was attached to the 78th
Highlanders, the old “Ross-shire Buffs,” now known
(with the 72nd Foot) as the Seaforth Highlanders. He
had followed his regiment to Cawnpore to avenge Nana
Sahib’s ghastly massacre, and thence to Lucknow,
which, under the gallant Henry Lawrence, was holding
out until relief came.</p>

<p>From the Alumbagh, the pleasure-house that was
built by a Begum of the ex-King of Oudh about two
miles out of the city, and was now garrisoned by some
12,000 sepoys, the relieving force, as is well known,
fought their way steadily across the Charbagh Bridge,
and so on to the Chutter Munzil Palace and the
Bailey Guard Gate, and eventually gained the Residency
itself.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 25th of September
that Lucknow was actually reached. At the Charbagh
Palace, near the bridge, the 78th Highlanders were
left to hold that position, while the main body threaded
its way through the narrow, tortuous lanes leading to
the Residency, and here Surgeon Jee and Assistant-Surgeon
McMaster quickly found work for their
hands. All the streets and houses in the vicinity
were strongly occupied by mutineers. Desperate
charges had to be made to carry the rebel guns which
poured a devastating fire upon our troops, and though
the cannon were captured and toppled over into the
canal, the casualties were exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p>While the wounded remained to receive attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
from the busy doctors, the regiment, following up its
last attack, disappeared round the bend of the canal,
and Jee and his assistants found themselves suddenly
exposed to the enemy’s fire. Having obtained some
men to act as bearers, the surgeon got his patients
lifted up and carried to where a few dhoolies were.
These were filled in no time, one of them by Captain
Havelock, son of the General, who was badly hit in
the arm; the rest of the wounded were placed in
carts drawn by bullocks. The latter, however, met
with a heartrending fate ere they had gone far;
for the sick train coming to a standstill in the
road where it was blocked, all the occupants of the
carts were massacred by sepoys before their comrades’
eyes.</p>

<p>The regiment was caught up at last, and a company
under Captain Halliburton detailed to guard the
dhoolies. But misfortune dogged the little party’s
steps. They lost their way in the city, were led by
a blundering guide right into an enemy’s battery,
which shelled them mercilessly, and wandered about
for hours continually under fire, until they took refuge
in the Moti-Mahal (the Pearl Palace). Here was
a square courtyard having sheds all round it and
two gateway entrances. As it was already packed
with soldiers, camp followers and camels, the surgeons
were hard put to it to find accommodation for their
wounded.</p>

<p>Of the horrors of that night Surgeon Jee has told
us in his own words. The firing was deafening, gongs
were sounding the hours, while there was a hubbub of
shouting through which the groans of the wounded
could nevertheless be heard. An alarming rumour
came that all the 78th had been killed, and, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
added to the terrors of the situation, no one knew
how far off the Residency was. But Jee stuck to his
post, and many a poor fellow lived through that
inferno to bless the brave, tender-hearted doctor to
whom he owed his life.</p>

<p>At daylight some tea was made (they had had
neither food nor drink since leaving the Alumbagh
the morning before), and then preparations were made
to defend the place. Loopholes had to be pierced
in the walls, and the best marksmen stationed there
to pick off the sepoys who raked the square from
house and gateway. Jee himself had many a narrow
escape as he dodged about dressing the wounds both
of the artillery and his own men, and he recounts
how Brigadier Cooper was shot through a loophole
close to where he was standing.</p>

<p>In this extremity Jee boldly volunteered to attempt
to get his wounded into the Residency by taking them
along the river bank, leaving Captain Halliburton to
hold the Moti-Mahal. Nothing could dissuade him
from this course once his mind was made up, so with
his dhoolies he set out to run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>What the little company of dhoolies passed through
ere it reached its destination we do not know, but we
can picture to ourselves that terrible journey through
the winding tangled streets in which nearly every
house contained sepoy riflemen. There was, too, a
stream to be crossed, and at this spot they were
exposed to the fire of the rebel guns at the Kaiserbagh
Palace.</p>

<p>They reached the Residency at length, after much
going astray, and reached it sadly depleted in numbers.
As elsewhere in Lucknow that same night, the
cowardly sepoys made a special mark of the dhoolies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
shooting the defenceless wounded in cold blood. On
their arrival General Havelock warmly congratulated
the plucky surgeon on his success in getting through,
for he had heard that Jee had been killed.</p>

<p>Honour was slower in coming to the brave Army
doctors than to many others who distinguished
themselves in the Mutiny, for it was not until three
years later that Jee was gazetted V.C. But such
services as his could not be overlooked, and there was
universal satisfaction when his name was added to the
Roll of Valour. He died some years ago, a Deputy
Inspector-General and a C.B.</p>

<p class="tb">On the night of the same day that Jee was conveying
his wounded to the Residency, a somewhat similar
scene was being enacted in another quarter of Lucknow.
By the Moti Munzil Palace lay a number of wounded
officers and men of the 90th and other regiments in
the charge of Doctors Home and Bradshaw of the
90th. Left behind by the relieving force as it held
straight on to its goal, the dhoolies had to rely for
protection on a small escort of a hundred and fifty men.
By great good fortune they escaped the notice of the
mutineers during the first part of the night, but ere
dawn had broken a fierce attack was made upon
them. Off they started, then, on a slow, laborious
journey, which was to cost many valuable lives before
its end.</p>

<p>“To the Residency!” was the cry, a young civilian
named Thornhill having undertaken to guide them
thither. But between them and Havelock’s house was
a network of streets and lanes that had to be threaded,
and these were still overrun with sepoys. It was a
true <i lang="it">via dolorosa</i> that lay before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The order having been given, the dhoolies were
picked up by very reluctant native bearers, the surgeons
closed in round their charges, and they started off,
while the escort covered their progress as best they
could. After a terrible hour’s journeying, with sepoys
hanging on flank and rear, the little company eventually
reached the Martinière (a building erected by a
French soldier of fortune in the eighteenth century).
Their stay here was short, however, for a well-directed
cannonade drove them once more afield. A flooded
nullah was next crossed, and beyond this seemed
to lie safety, but a fatal blunder on the part of their
guide led them into a veritable death-trap.</p>

<p>The street into which they filed appeared to be
deserted. As a matter of fact it was full of sepoys,
who were concealed in the houses on either side. This
was the narrow street leading to the Bailey Guard
Gate, the entrance to the Residency; along its three-quarters
of a mile, some hours previously, the 78th
Highlanders and Brasyer’s Sikhs had won their way
through a perfect tempest of shot. A similar reception
awaited the dhoolies.</p>

<p>As the ill-fated train passed through and gained the
square at the farther end, the storm of musketry broke
into full blast over their heads. In a moment the panic-stricken
bearers dropped the dhoolies and fled for dear
life, leaving the wounded men in the middle of the
square exposed to every sepoy marksman. The fire of
close on a thousand muskets must have been concentrated
on that small enclosure, but Surgeon Home
managed, with nine men of the escort, to get half a dozen
of the wounded within the shelter of a building before
which was a covered archway.</p>

<p>Surgeon Bradshaw, meanwhile, who had been in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rear of the train, had collected his dhoolies as soon as
the nature of the trap was disclosed, and turned hastily
back to seek the turning that their guide ought to have
taken. The luckless Thornhill had been killed, having
been one of the first to be shot down. It is satisfactory
to add that Bradshaw was successful in bringing his
dhoolies to safe quarters without further mishap.</p>

<p>Would that such had been the case with Surgeon
Home! He and his party had gained shelter for the
time, but none could say how long it would be before
the horde of sepoys would storm it. The most daring
of the mutineers had already ventured out into the
square to kill those of the wounded whom they could
reach and to fire through the windows of the house.</p>

<p>The heroes of what became known afterwards as
Dhoolie Square were, besides Home, Privates McManus,
Ward, Ryan, and Hollowell. These gallant fellows,
but for whom the whole company must have been
massacred, formed part of the military escort. Patrick
McManus, who was an Irishman of the Northumberland
Fusiliers, was a noted shot. Taking up a position
immediately behind one of the pillars of the archway,
he coolly fired shot after shot until a number of sepoys
had fallen victims to his unerring aim. The rest of
the rebels retreated before his rifle and sought shelter
within the houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;" id="illus5">

<p class="caption">McMANUS NOW RUSHED OUT, ACCOMPANIED BY PRIVATE JOHN
RYAN … AND CARRIED IN CAPTAIN ARNOLD.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_98">Page 98.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>This pause afforded an opportunity for rescuing those
of the wounded who lay within reach. With his deadly
rifle in his hand, McManus now rushed out, accompanied
by Private John Ryan (a Madras European Fusilier),
and carried in Captain Arnold, who had been shot in
both legs. A second time they ventured out, and in the
rain of bullets they drew upon themselves succeeded in
dragging another poor fellow from the slender security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of his dhoolie to more certain safety. But their errand
of mercy was in vain: though neither of the rescuers
was hit, Arnold and the other wounded man (a private)
were struck again and again, both dying soon after.</p>

<p>Private Ward, a 78th Highlander but a Norfolk
man by birth, had a little previously saved the life of
Lieutenant Havelock. The dhoolie in which the young
officer lay would have been abandoned had not Ward,
by force of blows, compelled the native bearers to carry
it behind the pillars of the arch.</p>

<p>Inside the house that sheltered Home and the others
the surgeon was hard at work attending to his wounded,
most of whom were in worse case than when they
started on their journey. If he stopped in his task it
was only to snatch up a rifle and take a shot at some
sepoy who was within sight. With consummate daring
the rebels braved McManus and crept up to the window
of Home’s room. One man, whom he shot with his
revolver, was no more than three yards away from him
at the time.</p>

<p>So some hours wore away. Then the sepoys,
furious at their ineffectual attempts to get at their
prey, brought up a large screen on wheels, with thick
planks in front, and with this shut off what was
apparently the little garrison’s only exit. It was their
intention to fire the roof and burn the Englishmen in
their trap.</p>

<p>There was another door at the side of the house,
however, and while the flames crackled and the choking
smoke filled the rooms, Home and all the able
men with him seized hold of the wounded and made
a dash through this across the square to a small shed
that appeared to be empty. They reached it, but only
half a dozen were in a condition to handle their rifles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
The remnant that had struggled through with them
could hardly raise themselves from the floor.</p>

<p>The shed being loopholed, McManus and his
comrades Ward and Ryan, together with another 78th
man, named Hollowell, were able to keep the sepoys
at a distance. They could not prevent, however, the
ghastly murder of the wounded, who still lay in the
dhoolies at the farther end of the square. One after
another the unfortunate men were shot or bayoneted
as they lay, only one (an officer of the 90th), it is
recorded, escaping by a miracle.</p>

<p>All the rest of that fearful day, and throughout the
night, the brave surgeon and his handful of men held
their fort against the swarms of mutineers who surged
again and again to the attack. In the darkness they
heard the sepoys tramping about on the roof, but a
few well-aimed shots put these daring spirits to flight.
The lack of water was now keenly felt, some of the
wounded suffering terribly for want of it. Moved to
desperation by their piteous cries, and hoping to
secure a safer position, Home and a private at last
stole out into the square and made their way to a
mosque some yards distant. They obtained some
water, but a vigilant sepoy espied their movements,
and the plucky pair only just got back to the shed in
time.</p>

<p>“The terrors of that awful night,” says Dr. Home
in his account of his experiences, “were almost
maddening: raging thirst, uncertainty as to where the
sepoys would next make an attack; together with the
exhaustion produced by want of food, heat, and anxiety.”</p>

<p>But morning saw them still alive, and with the
daylight came the welcome sound of rifle volleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
unmistakably British. Ryan, who was acting as
sentry at a loophole, sprang excitedly to his feet and
roused his comrades with the shout, “Oh, boys,
them’s our own chaps!”</p>

<p>And a few minutes later into the corpse-strewn
square swept a column of redcoats, driving the sepoys
before them in wild confusion. With Home leading
them, the heroes of Dhoolie Square gave as loud a
cheer as their feeble voices could raise, and flinging
open the door of their refuge, rushed out to greet
their rescuers.</p>

<p>Surgeon Home (he is now Sir Anthony Dickson
Home, K.C.B.), and Privates McManus, Ward, Ryan,
and Hollowell, all received the Cross for Valour for
their splendid devotion and bravery; and never, surely,
did men deserve the honour more. To have held
something like a thousand rebels in check for a day
and a night, and to have protected as many of their
wounded as they did, was a feat that they might well
be proud of.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;THREE BRAVE CIVILIANS: MANGLES, MCDONELL,
AND “LUCKNOW” KAVANAGH.</span></h2>

<p>On the 8th of July 1859 an interesting announcement
appeared in the <cite>London Gazette</cite> to the
effect that her Majesty the Queen had been pleased to
declare that Non-Military Persons who, as Volunteers,
had borne arms against the Mutineers, both at
Lucknow and elsewhere, during the late operations in
India, should be considered as eligible to receive the
decoration of the Victoria Cross, subject to the rules
and ordinances, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Under this new clause Mr. Ross Lowis Mangles,
of the Bengal Civil Service, Assistant-Magistrate at
Patna; Mr. William Fraser McDonell, Magistrate of
the Saran District; and Mr. Thomas Henry Kavanagh,
Assistant-Commissioner in Oudh, were gazetted, for
distinguished services rendered at Arrah and Lucknow.</p>

<p>The defence of Arrah, a town in the Shahabad
District of Bengal, about thirty-six miles from Patna,
was one of the most thrilling incidents of the Indian
Mutiny. Here for a whole week a dozen Englishmen
and a small body of Sikhs, shut up in a two-storeyed
house, successfully kept off over two thousand sepoys
until a relief force came to their rescue. One young
lieutenant of the Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with a few sowars at his back, might storm
a seemingly impregnable fort strongly garrisoned by
mutineers, and kill or capture every man of them, but
reverse the positions and a very different story was
told. The history of the Great Mutiny contains many
instances of a mere handful of Englishmen holding
their own against tremendous odds, as was done at
Arrah.</p>

<p>When news came of the outbreak at Arrah and the
predicament of the white residents there, a relief
expedition was hastily organised at Dinapur under the
command of Captain Dunbar. It was destined to fail
in its mission, but it was a gallant and notable
attempt. The force comprised four hundred men,
drawn from the 10th and 37th Regiments, with a
sprinkling of volunteers. Among the latter were
Messrs. Ross Mangles and McDonell, whose intimate
knowledge of the district made them invaluable as
guides.</p>

<p>All went well with the expedition in its journey
up the Ganges and, on landing, it marched several
miles without serious molestation. But when within
a few miles of Arrah it was obliged to pass through a
thick piece of jungle in which the sepoys had laid an
ambuscade. Darkness had fallen as the soldiers
pushed their way through the maze of trees and dense
undergrowth, and the murderous fire that suddenly
broke out threw them into confusion.</p>

<p>All through the night the unequal fight went on,
but the loss on the British side was so heavy that
when morning dawned the surviving officers saw it
would be impossible, or at least unwise, to continue
the advance. Captain Dunbar, unfortunately, had
been among the first to fall. Very reluctantly, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the order to retreat was given, and the little
force, still firing on its foes, slowly fell back. Other
sepoys had arrived on the scene in the meantime,
and the exhausted soldiers now found themselves
compelled to run the gauntlet between two lines of
fire. In these conditions something like a panic at
last set in; the ranks broke up in disorder.</p>

<p>“But, disastrous as was the retreat,” says one
account, “it was not all disgraceful. There will
always be acts of individual heroism when Englishmen
go out to battle. It may be a soldier or it may be a
civilian, in whom the irrepressible warrior instinct
manifests itself in some act of conspicuous gallantry
and devotion, but it is sure never to be wanting.”</p>

<p>In this instance it was the civilian who rose to the
occasion. Early in the engagement Mr. Mangles had
been hit by a musket ball, but the shot had luckily
only stunned him. Quickly recovering, he lent a hand
in helping the wounded, and on the retreat commencing
he played an active part in beating off the
sepoys. With a number of men round him to reload
and supply him with muskets, he shot sepoy after
sepoy, the sure eye and hand which had made him a
noted tiger shot not failing him in this hour of need.</p>

<p>The especial act for which he was awarded the
Cross, however, was the gallant rescue of a wounded
private of the Hampshires (the 37th Foot). At the
man’s piteous appeal to his comrades not to leave him
there helpless to be hacked to pieces by the sepoys,
Mangles nobly rushed to his side, bound up his wounds,
and then lifted him on to his back. With this heavy
burden the brave civilian trudged on among the
others.</p>

<p>It was rough going for the greater part of the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
miles to the river, the ground being very swampy, and
overhead was a broiling July sun. Despite these
disadvantages, and the fact that he had not slept for
forty-eight hours, Mangles bore the helpless private the
whole of the way, only stopping now and then to place
his charge on the ground and take a pot-shot at the
pursuing rebels. “I really never felt so strong in my
life,” he used to say afterwards in referring to this
incident. When the waters of the Ganges were
reached he plunged in and swam out to the boats
with his now unconscious burden. Then, when all
the survivors were aboard, the flotilla started on its
sad return journey.</p>

<p>Mr. McDonell all this time had been ever to the
front, assisting the officers to keep the men together.
An excellent shot, like his fellow-magistrate, he
accounted for many a rebel ere the river-side was
reached, but he did not escape unscathed. A musket
shot had lodged in his arm.</p>

<p>In the wild rush for the half-dozen country boats
moored close to the river bank, McDonell gave no
thought to himself. There were several men very
badly hit, and it was not until he had seen these safely
over the thwarts that he jumped in and cast the
mooring adrift. He was the last man aboard his
boat, which was crowded with thirty-five soldiers.</p>

<p>Out into the stream they floated, but now a fresh
danger faced them. The rebels had removed the oars
from the boat and lashed the rudder tightly, so that
the little craft was helpless. To their horror it began
to drift back again to the southern bank, on which the
sepoys were clustered in joyful expectation of emptying
their muskets into the boatload of sahibs. Something
had to be done at once, or they were doomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>To show his face above the gunwale was to court
instant death, but McDonell took the risk. With a
knife in his hand, he climbed outside on to the canvas
roof, worked his way to the stern and with a few deft
slashes cut the ropes that held the tiller fast. Bullets
pattered all round him as he lay outstretched there,
and one passed clean through his helmet, but he was
otherwise untouched. Having regained his seat
safely, he steered the boat and its precious freight to
the opposite bank, where they landed&mdash;three men
short. The sepoys’ fire had not been all in vain.</p>

<p>While, as I have said, both Mangles and McDonell
received the V.C. for their bravery on this occasion,
it is a remarkable fact that the former’s exploit would
have passed unnoticed by the authorities but for a
happy chance. The private whose life he had saved
and who had passed some months in Dinapur Hospital
before being invalided home, had told the story of his
rescue to a surgeon. This worthy noted it down at the
time in his journal, and just twelve months later made
the true facts public.</p>

<p>It was only in March of last year that Mr. Ross
Lowis Mangles died at his home in Surrey, where, after
long service in India, he had settled down to spend
the remaining years of his life.</p>

<p class="tb">Of the three civilians who have won the V.C.
“Lucknow” Kavanagh is the most famous. The
story of his daring journey in disguise through the
rebel lines in order to act as guide to Sir Colin
Campbell’s relief force has been told over and over
again, but one can never tire of hearing it. It thrills
our pulses now as much as ever it did.</p>

<p>Thomas Henry Kavanagh was an Irishman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Indian Civil Service. At the time the Mutiny broke
out he held the post of Superintendent of the office of
the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, and took up his
residence in Lucknow. Here with his wife he played
no mean part in these fateful months before and after
Havelock and Outram had fought their way to the aid
of the Residency garrison, taking his share of work in
the trenches or at the guns as required.</p>

<p>Early in November 1857, Sir Colin Campbell,
marching with a large army to the relief of Lucknow,
got as far as the Alumbagh. To save the General
from having to make the perilous passage through the
narrow streets and lanes which had cost him so many
men two months earlier, Outram by means of a native
spy sent plans of the city and its approaches to
Campbell, and suggested the best route to be followed.
There was still the danger, however, of some dreadful
blunder being committed, and Outram expressed a wish
that he were able to send a competent guide.</p>

<p>This coming to Kavanagh’s ears, he promptly went
to Outram’s Chief of Staff, Colonel Robert Napier,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and volunteered his services in this capacity. The
colonel stared at him in blank astonishment, as well
he might, for of all men in Lucknow Kavanagh
looked to be the one least suited to play the rôle of
spy. He was a tall, big-limbed man, with fair complexion,
“aggressively red hair and beard, and uncompromisingly
blue eyes.” To transform this healthy
specimen of an Irishman into a native seemed an utter
impossibility.</p>

<p>But Kavanagh persisted that he could get through
to the British lines. He would be disguised, of course
and his knowledge of Hindustani and local dialects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was perfect. He persisted more strenuously still
when, on his being ushered into Outram’s presence, the
General refused point blank to consent to his going.
After much arguing, he at length persuaded Outram
to listen to his plan, and extorted a half-hearted
permission to make the attempt. It remained for
him to convince his chief of the impenetrability of
his disguise.</p>

<p>Kavanagh has told us in his own account of the
adventure, how the same evening (Nov. 9th), with face,
neck, and arms blackened with lamp-black, his red hair
hidden beneath a cream-coloured turban, and the rest
of his person disguised in the silk trousers, yellow
<em>koortah</em>, or jacket, white cummerbund, and chintz
mantle of an irregular native soldier, he sauntered
with sword and shield into Napier’s quarters.</p>

<p>The experiment was an immense success. Seeing
what was evidently a <em>budmash</em> (a worthless fellow)
thus insolently thrusting himself upon them, the
officers present bade him begone, and a very pretty
squabble in low-class Hindustani ensued. In the
midst of it Sir James Outram entered the room, and
having sufficiently tested his disguise Kavanagh made
himself known. To his joy, no opposition was now
raised to his plan.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with the native spy Kunoujee
Lal, who was returning to the Alumbagh with a
letter from Outram, he bade good-bye to his friends,
forded the river Goomtee, and started on his perilous
mission.</p>

<p>“My courage failed me,” he confesses, “while in
the water, and if my guide had been within my reach
I should perhaps have pulled him back and abandoned
the enterprise. But he waded quickly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
stream, and, reaching the opposite bank, went crouching
up a ditch for three hundred yards to a grove of
low trees on the edge of a pond, where we stopped to
dress.”</p>

<p>His confidence having returned, Kavanagh went
boldly forward, tulwar on shoulder, and even dared to
accost a matchlock man near a hut with a remark
that the night was cold. A little farther on they
were pulled up by the officer of a native picket, and
Kunoujee Lal, acting as spokesman, explained that
they had come from Mundeon (“our old cantonment”)
and were making their way to their homes in the
city. This satisfied the sepoy officer, and they passed
on with no little relief.</p>

<p>Recrossing the river by the iron bridge, they safely
negotiated the streets of Lucknow, though the place
swarmed with sentries and armed men, and issuing at
last from the city on the other side, breathed more
freely.</p>

<p>“I was in great spirits when we reached the green
fields, into which I had not been for five months,”
says Kavanagh. “Everything around us smelt sweet,
and a carrot I took from the roadside was the most
delicious I had ever tasted.”</p>

<p>A wrong turning now led them astray into the
Dilkusha Park, where the rebels had a battery. Much
against his companion’s will, the daring Irishman
insisted on inspecting these guns, and Kunoujee Lal
was in considerable trepidation until after two hours’
weary tramping across paddy fields and canal cuttings
they regained the right road.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the morning, after several alarms
from suspicious villagers who chased them some
distance, they stumbled upon a picket of twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sepoys on the outskirts of the city. Kavanagh was
for the bold course of going up and questioning the
men, but Kunoujee Lal lost heart and threw away
the letter entrusted to him for Sir Colin Campbell.
Kavanagh kept his still concealed in his turban.</p>

<p>The picket was in some alarm at their approach,
but it proved to be fear lest the pair were Englishmen
from the Alumbagh camp, only a mile or two in
advance of them! With this cheering news, the two
spies pushed on, a friendly sepoy having put them on
the right road on hearing that they were “walking to
the village of Umroula on a sad errand, namely, to
inform a friend that his brother had been killed
by a ball from the British entrenchments at
Lucknow.”</p>

<p>A nasty tumble into a swamp, which washed the
black from Kavanagh’s hands, was their next most
serious <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>. For some time they waded
through it waist-deep, having gone too far to recede
before they discovered it was a swamp. An hour
afterwards they stole unobserved through two pickets
of sepoys and gained the shelter of a grove of trees,
where Kavanagh insisted on having a good sleep.
Kunoujee Lal, by no means assured that they were
out of danger, kept a fearful watch, but nobody came
near them save some flying natives, who stated that
they had been pursued by British soldiers.</p>

<p>Kavanagh having been roused, the two went on
once more. Another mile or so was traversed, and
then (it being about four o’clock in the morning of
the 10th) the welcome challenge “Who goes
there?” rang on their ears. It was a mounted
patrol of Sikhs. They had reached the British
outposts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Two men of the patrol guided Kavanagh and his
companion to the camp, where they were immediately
conducted into the presence of Sir Colin Campbell.
When he learned that Kavanagh had come through
the rebel lines, the Commander-in-Chief could not find
enough words to express his admiration. “I consider
his escape,” he wrote in his despatch, “at a time
when the entrenchment was closely invested by a
large army, one of the most daring feats ever
attempted.”</p>

<p>For his part, Kavanagh paid a generous tribute to
his fellow-spy, Kunoujee Lal, who had displayed
wonderful courage and intelligence in their trying
journey. When they were questioned, it was the
native who did most of the speaking, and he always
had a ready answer for the most searching interrogation.</p>

<p>The news of Kavanagh’s arrival was signalled to
Lucknow by means of a flag from the summit of the
Alumbagh, and Outram’s mind was set at ease. In
due course the plucky Irishman guided Sir Colin into
the city, being present through all the fierce fighting at
the Secunderabagh and the Moti-Mahal, and further
distinguishing himself by saving a wounded soldier’s
life. Nor does this close the tale of his adventures,
for he passed through many exciting experiences in
rebel-hunting ere the Mutiny was suppressed.</p>

<p>Kavanagh lived to wear the Victoria Cross for
twenty-three years, dying in 1882 at Gibraltar. His
Cross was presented by his son to the N.W.P. and
Oudh Provincial Museum at Lucknow, while the
tulwar, shield and pistol he bore on his journey,
together with other articles of his disguise, are preserved
in the Dublin Museum.</p>

<span class="smaller">INDIA.&mdash;SOME OTHER CROSSES OF THE MUTINY.</span></h2>

<p>The full tale of the Crosses of the Mutiny (do they
not number one hundred and eighty-two in all?)
is a long one, and cannot be told here. But before
bringing this chapter of V.C. history to a close I must
tell of yet a few more and the manner of their winning,
for they call to mind deeds which we ought not willingly
to let fade from our memories.</p>

<p>I would like much to dwell, did space permit, on
Lawrence’s heroic stand at the Lucknow Residency;
to tell of Lieutenant Robert Aitken of the Bailey
Guard “Post,” who won the V.C. many times over
in that six-months’ siege; of brave Commissioner
Gubbins; and of Captain Fulton, the garrison engineer,
who had a countermine for every mine that the
rebels drove under the British defences, and to whom
the dangerous game of sepoy hunting above and
below earth was “great fun and excitement.” They
were gallant fellows all, and the record of their
exploits is truly an inspiring one; but I must hurry
on to the taking of Lucknow, and to the story of the
V.C.’s gained in that last desperate struggle for
supremacy.</p>

<p>When Sir Colin Campbell started on his march to
the relief of Havelock and Outram he had an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of only some 4700 men, but in this force were picked
regiments such as the 93rd Highlanders, the 9th
Lancers, Hodson’s Horse, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers,
and the 53rd Foot (the “Shropshires”), together with
some squadrons of Sikh cavalry and two regiments
of Punjab infantry. The famous 93rd were Sir
Colin’s special favourites. They had been with him
in the Crimea, and had formed the “thin red line”
which had so successfully routed the Russian cavalry.
“You are my own lads, Ninety-third!” he said,
addressing them at the parade at Buntera, “and I
rely on you to do the work;” to which the stern-faced
Highlanders, mindful of what had been done at
Cawnpore, responded with a mighty shout.</p>

<p>How well the 93rd acquitted themselves is to
be read in any history; what is of particular interest
here is that they gained no fewer than seven Crosses
in the Lucknow fighting.</p>

<p>Four of these belong to the fierce assault on the
Secunderabagh, the first and most formidable rebel
position to be attacked. When the artillery had
made a breach in the face of the fortress wall there
was a race between Sikhs and Highlanders to be
the first in. Accounts differ as to the result; some
say a Sikh won the honour, being shot dead instantly;
others a Highlander, who suffered the same fate.
However that may be, it is pretty certain that Lance-Corporal
Dunley of the 93rd (Archibald Forbes writes
him down an Irishman) was the first man of his
regiment to reach the goal and get through alive.</p>

<p>Behind him streamed Highlanders and Sikhs,
tumbling in with bayonets fixed, before which
the sepoys fell in scores. There were upwards of 2000
rebels in the Secunderabagh, and but three or four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
says Lord Roberts, dropped over the wall on the city
side and escaped. Every other man of them was
killed. The carnage that took place within the
courtyard almost passes description.</p>

<p>In the first terrible rush, which resolved itself into
a series of personal combats, Private P. Grant and
Colour-Sergeant J. Munro distinguished themselves by
saving the lives of two officers. Grant saw his officer
in difficulties with a crowd of sepoys whose colour he
had captured, and rushing up cut down five of the
rebels. That was not the only sepoy ensign taken
that day, for Private D. Mackay secured one after
a fierce contest and bore it triumphantly away.</p>

<p>Dunley, Grant, Munro, and Mackay were elected
by their comrades as most worthy to be decorated
when their regiment was singled out for distinction,
and each duly received the V.C.</p>

<p>There was a Punjabi Mahommedan, by the way,
Mukarrab Khan by name, who in this same Secunderabagh
fight earned the V.C. as much as did any
man. Lord Roberts, who was an eye-witness, tells
the story of his bravery. The enemy, he says, having
been driven out of the earthwork, made for the gateway,
which they nearly succeeded in shutting behind
them. But just as the doors were closing Mukarrab
Khan pushed his left arm, on which he bore a shield,
between them. A sword-cut slashed his hand, whereupon
the dauntless Mahommedan, withdrawing his
left arm, thrust in his right, and had his other hand
all but severed at the wrist. He gained his object,
however, for he kept the doors from being closed until
his comrades rushed to his help and forced them open.</p>

<p>It was an act of heroic devotion, and it is satisfactory
to know that Mukarrab Khan was awarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the Order of Merit, which is the Indian equivalent
of the V.C., and carries with it an increase of pay.</p>

<p>At the taking of the Shah Nujeef, on the same day,
the 16th of November 1857, Sergeant John Paton,
of the 93rd, did a daring thing, which added another
V.C. to the regimental record.</p>

<p>The Shah Nujeef was a mosque built over the tomb
of an old king of Oudh, a massively built structure
with loopholed walls, and the guns of the Naval
Brigade, under Captain Peel, were unable to make
a breach. As night was fast coming on, Sir Colin
Campbell determined to make a bold effort to carry
the place by storm, and called on the Highlanders to
follow him. That the 93rd would have scaled the
walls of the mosque though half of them fell in the
task need not be doubted, but fortunately they were
not called on to do so.</p>

<p>Soon after the order to advance had been given,
Sergeant Paton came tearing down the ravine with
the news that he had discovered a breach in the north-east
corner of the rampart, close by the river Goomtee.
“It appears,” says Forbes-Mitchell of the 93rd, who
records the incident, “that our shot and shell had
gone over the first breach, and had blown out the
wall on the other side in this particular spot. Paton
told how he had climbed up to the top of the ramparts
without difficulty, and seen right inside the
place, as the whole defending force had been called
forward to repulse the assault in front.”</p>

<p>A detachment was promptly sent round to this
point with the sergeant as guide, and an entrance to
the position effected. But the sepoys, finding themselves
thus taken in the rear, gave up the fight and
fled with all speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The other two V.C. heroes of the Highlanders were
Captain Stewart, who headed a splendid charge
against the rebel guns at the position known as
the Mess-house; and Lieutenant and Adjutant William
M’Bean, who at the onslaught on the Begumbagh
Palace bore himself like a paladin of old, and was
seen to slay eleven sepoys single-handed. M’Bean
was a mighty figure in a corps wherein every man
was a doughty fighter, and the tale of his exploits is
a notable one. An Inverness ploughman before he
enlisted, he rose to command the regiment which he
had entered as a private, and died a Major-General.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the Naval Brigade in connection
with the attack on the Shah Nujeef. Peel’s gallant
bluejackets, whom we last met doing great things at
Sebastopol, had been hurried to India from their
station at Hong Kong, immediately news arrived of
the outbreak of the Mutiny; and after smelling
powder at Cawnpore and other places they accompanied
the relief army to Lucknow.</p>

<p>Right up under the frowning walls of the mosque
did they run their useful 24-pounders, as coolly as if
“laying alongside an enemy’s frigate,” to use Sir
Colin’s own words. But the guns were not powerful
enough to break down the masonry. Despite the
obvious hopelessness of the task, however, Lieutenant
Young and Seaman William Hall (a negro, be it noted)
fearlessly stood by their gun, reloading and pounding
away at the wall under a most deadly fire, and only
desisting when the order eventually came to fall
back. They both got the V.C. for that gallant action.</p>

<p>The other Crosses that fell to the Naval men in
the same fight were won by a young lieutenant whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
name still figures on the Active List as Admiral Sir
Nowell Salmon, G.C.B., and Boatswain’s Mate John
Harrison. These two pluckily volunteered to climb
trees that overlooked the mosque walls and reconnoitre
the rebel position, at the same time picking off the
sepoys with their rifles. A mark at once for the rebel
sharpshooters, who quickly espied them, both men
drew upon themselves a heavy fire, but though they
were wounded they accounted for several mutineers
ere clambering down from their perches, and secured
valuable information for their commander.</p>

<p>In the taking of Lucknow young Lieutenant Henry
Havelock, son of the famous General, played a prominent
part, leading a storming party that captured a
palace close to the rebel citadel, the Kaisarbagh. But
he had won his V.C. before this, at Cawnpore, where
he captured a rebel gun in the face of an appalling
fire; and at the Charbagh Bridge, Lucknow, while
serving under his father.</p>

<p>His action at the latter place was characteristic
of his impulsive bravery. Neill, who held a position
by the bridge, would not move to “rush” the sepoys
and their guns without orders from Outram. Wheeling
his horse, it is said, young Havelock rode off in
the direction of the General and his staff, but soon
after turning the bend in the road he galloped hastily
back to trick Neill into taking action. Giving a
salute, he said, “You are to carry the bridge at
once, sir!”</p>

<p>Taking this to be an order from the General, Neill
gave the word to advance, and Arnold of the Madras
Fusiliers led his men forward in a gallant charge,
being shot down almost immediately. A storm of
grape swept the bridge clear, and Havelock found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
himself the only officer&mdash;and almost the only man&mdash;standing
there alive. With a wave of his sword and
a shout to the rest of the Fusiliers whom the guns
had checked, he led a second charge, and this time the
bridge was won.</p>

<p>Young Havelock’s gallantry in the Indian Mutiny
marked him out for a distinguished career, and he did
not disappoint those who prophesied thus concerning
him. As is well known, he became in after
years Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Havelock-Allan,
Bart., K.C.B.</p>

<p>Among the many other pictures of the Mutiny
that present themselves vividly to my mind is one
of a young Fusilier officer swimming the river
Goomtee in plain sight of any sepoys who might be
upon the farther bank, and audaciously climbing up
the parapet of a rebel battery. It had been shelled
by our troops, but with what success was not known.
He stands there on the wall signalling to his impatient
comrades that it is abandoned, but it is some time ere
their officers will let them follow where he has led.
The Highlanders and Sikhs get across the river at
last, however, and with a laugh at the discomfited
sepoys who have been vainly trying to “pot” him
from an adjacent battery, the young officer&mdash;Butler
by name&mdash;hands over his captured position to the
new-comers, and swims back to his own regiment.</p>

<p>That was a V.C. exploit, and it holds the imagination
as much as does that which won the decoration
for Ensign Patrick Roddy of the Bengal Army.
The scene of Roddy’s achievement was Kuthirga,
and the date September 27, 1858. At the close of
an action with a rebel force at this place some of the
cavalry were kept at bay for some time by a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sepoy subadar of a revolted regiment, a tall,
powerful fellow. This man knelt alone in the
middle of the road and with musket at shoulder
covered his enemies.</p>

<p>While his sowars hung back, afraid to face that
gleaming barrel, young Roddy did not hesitate.
Spurring his horse, he charged straight upon the rebel
subadar, who firing at close range brought down
the ensign’s horse. Roddy had some difficulty in
freeing himself from the stirrups as he lay on the
ground, but ere the sepoy could get really to grips
with him he managed to draw his sword, and in the
tussle ran the fellow through the body. Sir Hope
Grant had had occasion previously to remark on the
young ensign’s conspicuous bravery, and he took care
that this special feat was fittingly rewarded.</p>

<p>Mention of Roddy’s hand-to-hand combat reminds
me of the great fight between Sapper Sam Shaw, of
the Rifle Brigade, and a white muslin-clad Ghazi, at
Nawabgunge. It was after the sharp action at that
place in June 1858 that the fanatic was seen to
enter a grove of trees. A dozen men hastened in
pursuit, but Shaw was easily the first, and coming up
with his man he engaged him with the short sword
that sappers carry.</p>

<p>A Ghazi at best is a dangerous fellow to tackle, and
a Ghazi wounded and at bay, as this one was, might
well have made Sam Shaw hesitate before venturing
to attack him alone. But the sapper was not a man
to think twice of danger, and in he went, sword against
tulwar, until after several minutes’ fierce hacking and
thrusting he saw his chance to close, and finished the
affair with a mighty lunge.</p>

<p>It was a great fight, as I have said, and Sapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Shaw well earned the V.C. he got for it. But against
his decoration he had to put a terrible slashing cut on
the head from that keen-edged tulwar, a wound that
came very near to ending his career then and
there.</p>

<p>Last on my list of Mutiny V.C.’s come Lance-Corporal
William Goate, of the 9th Lancers, and that popular
hero, Sir Evelyn Wood, whose names still figure in the
list of surviving recipients of the Cross for Valour.</p>

<p>Goate had just been three years and a half in the
Lancers when the Mutiny broke out. His regiment
was stationed at Umballa at the time, and proceeded
at once to Delhi. After the fall of the old Punjab
capital he was at the second captures of Cawnpore and
Lucknow, taking part in some of the fiercest engagements
of the campaign, and it was here&mdash;at Lucknow&mdash;that
he performed the deed of valour which won
him the Cross.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March&mdash;a blazing hot day, it is
recorded&mdash;there was a bold sortie from the rebel lines
which a British brigade was sent to repulse. The 9th
Lancers was one of the regiments ordered to charge,
and away they went, neck and neck with the 2nd
Dragoons, for the enemy who had taken up their
position on the racecourse. The sepoys broke before
the onset of the cavalrymen, but the latter at length
had to retire owing to a heavy fire from artillery
and battery.</p>

<p>In the ride back Major Percy Smith, of the Dragoons,
was shot through the body and fell from his horse.
Corporal Goate was close by, and springing to the
ground he quickly lifted the major on to his shoulder
and ran with him thus alongside his horse. The
major was a heavy weight, however; Goate found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
himself lagging behind with several of the enemy
close upon him. Clearly he couldn’t get away with
his burden, so he determined to do what he could
for himself and the major. Placing the wounded
officer on the ground, he sprang into his saddle and
rode at his foes.</p>

<p>“I shot the first sepoy who charged,” he says in his
account of the incident, “and with my empty pistol
felled another. This gave me time to draw my sword,
my lance having been left on the field. The sepoys
were now round me cutting and hacking, but I
managed to parry every slash and deliver many a
fatal thrust. It was parry and thrust, thrust and
parry all through, and I cannot tell you how many
saddles I must have emptied. The enemy didn’t seem
to know how to parry.”</p>

<p>So our brave corporal (he was only a little more
than twenty, mind you) “settled accounts with a jolly
lot,” and was still hard at it when some of his comrades
came to his assistance. In the fight his horse had
carried him some distance from where the major lay,
and when the rebels had been forced back he went out
again to look for him. Poor Major Smith was found
after a long search, but it was a mutilated corpse
that was brought sadly and reverently back to the
camp.</p>

<p>Sir Colin Campbell and Sir Hope Grant had seen
Goate’s gallant attempt at rescue, and after the action
there was a cordial handshake for him from both the
veterans, with many compliments upon his pluck that
filled the corporal with just pride.</p>

<p>The scene of Sir Evelyn Wood’s principal exploit
was the wilds of Sindhora, near Gwalior. It was at
the close of the Mutiny, when the rebels had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
split up and only kept the fires of rebellion burning
in detached districts. After a fatiguing pursuit of some
mutineers one day, news came to the young officer’s ears
(he was a lieutenant in the 17th Lancers then) that a
potail&mdash;a loyal native named Chemmum Singh&mdash;had
been carried off by a band of these marauders. With
a duffadar, two or three sowars of Beatson’s Horse, and
half a dozen sepoys of the Bareilly Levy, he started off
promptly in pursuit.</p>

<p>The mutineers were discovered at night in the
jungle, twelve miles away, preparing to hang their
captive. Creeping up unseen, Lieutenant Wood and
his few followers sprang upon them from several points
at once, firing a volley and shouting as if they had a
whole company behind them. This was enough for
the rebels. They took to their heels incontinently,
and before they could rally and discover the numbers
of their assailants Wood and his men were riding
swiftly back with the released potail.</p>

<p>That daring adventure, together with a very
notable rout of rebel cavalry at Sindwaho a little
earlier, was sufficient recommendation for the V.C., and
the honour, though slow in coming, was eventually
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>It is curious to note how persistently the authorities
refused to recognise Evelyn Wood’s valour. In the
Crimea, where as a middy he served with the Naval
Brigade, he was singled out for distinction for his
bravery at the Redan assault; but his claim was
ignored, despite the strong protests of his commander,
Captain Lushington.</p>

<p>His subsequent career, after he had abandoned the
Navy for the Army, should be well known to every
British boy. There has not been a war since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Mutiny in which he has not played a leading part,&mdash;witness
the Ashanti, Zulu, Transvaal, and Egyptian
campaigns,&mdash;and to-day there is no finer soldier in the
service than the ex-Sirdar of the Egyptian army, Field-Marshal
Sir Henry Evelyn Wood, G.C.B.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE SIXTIES.&mdash;CHINA, JAPAN, INDIA, WEST AFRICA,
AND CANADA.</span></h2>

<p>The principal war in which we were engaged in
the sixties was that waged against the Maoris
in New Zealand, but that demands a chapter to itself.
For the present I will confine myself to some of the
smaller campaigns of the same period which yielded
several notable V.C.’s.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1859 trouble broke out afresh
with China, immediately after the conclusion of what
is known as the Second Chinese War. Sir F. Bruce,
the British Commissioner, while sailing up the Pei-ho
to Pekin to ratify the treaty just made with the
Emperor, was fired upon by the Taku Forts at the
mouth of the river. No apologies being forthcoming,
an expedition under General Sir James Hope Grant
was despatched to teach the Chinese a salutary lesson.</p>

<p>The expedition, which was strengthened by a French
force, was ready to begin operations against the Taku
Forts by July 1860, but owing to the swampy nature
of the country around them a halt had to be called
while the engineers set to work to make roads. These
were completed by the middle of August, and then the
attack commenced in real earnest.</p>

<p>Under a heavy fire from the Chinese gunners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
English and French vied with each other to be the
first to cross the ditches in front of the forts. Scaling-ladders
and pontoon bridges were requisitioned, but
the delay in placing these in position galled a number
of our men to such an extent that privates and officers
alike plunged boldly into the water and swam across.
The first to reach the walls were Lieutenant Robert
Rogers, of the 44th Regiment, two Lieutenants of the
67th, E. H. Lenon and Nathaniel Burslem, with
Privates John M’Dougall and Thomas Lane. Up
through the embrasures they all clambered, Burslem
and Lane being specially noticed as they knocked
away a portion of the wall and enlarged the opening
sufficiently to enable them to scramble through, just
as did Dunley at the Secunderabagh fight.</p>

<p>Where they showed the way their comrades quickly
followed, the while some of the French with ladders
vainly attempted to climb the walls. At the head of
the 67th Regiment came Ensign Chaplin, bearing
proudly the colour which he was determined to plant
first upon the fort. He had hardly gained the ditch,
however, when a bullet struck him in the arm,
making him drop the standard. There was a brief
pause while he bound a handkerchief tightly round
his wound, then on he went again, colours raised
aloft.</p>

<p>A French regiment of infantry was pressing forward
at the same time, and Chaplin playfully called to their
colour-bearer to race him to the fort. The challenge
was promptly taken up. As soon as the breach was
clear the ensign dashed for it, and by strenuous effort
forced his way inside. Before him were Chinese riflemen
and pikemen, but he cut his way through them
with his sword, and hurried on to his goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a second bullet caught him, making him
stagger, at which a private clutched at the swaying
standard pole.</p>

<p>“Hands off!” cried Chaplin vehemently, for he saw
that the French colour-bearer was now close behind
him. And, pulling himself together gamely, he made
a last spurt for the summit, which he reached well in
advance of all others. In a moment the flag was
planted, amid a ringing British cheer; then the brave
young ensign was seen to fall. A shot in the leg had
brought him down at last.</p>

<p>Seeing him prone on the ground at their mercy, the
Chinese made a rush for him, but they were luckily
too late. The 67th swarmed up the hill, and Chaplin
was rescued to survive that engagement and many
others, and wear on his breast the Cross for Valour
in token of his gallantry. At the same time that he
was gazetted the names of Rogers, Lenon, Burslem,
M’Dougall, and Lane also appeared, the V.C. having
been bestowed upon them for that bold dash at the
breach.</p>

<p>The obvious similarity of the incidents makes it unnecessary
for me to more than just refer here to the
deed for which Midshipman D. G. Boyes and Captain
of the After-Guard Thomas Pride, of H.M.S. <i>Euryalus</i>,
won the Cross. Their vessel formed one of the fleet
under Vice-Admiral Kuper which was sent to Japan
in 1863 to demand reparation from the Mikado’s
Government for certain outrages committed. At the
attack on Shimonoseki Boyes carried the colour of the
leading regiment, with Pride as one of his colour-sergeants
(the other fell mortally wounded in the
thick of the fight), and was almost the first to get
inside the enemy’s stockade. That the middy ran a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
terrible risk is evident from the fact that the colour
he carried was pierced no fewer than six times by
musket balls.</p>

<p>Out in the Indian state of Bhotan in 1865 an act
of remarkable daring was performed, which brought
the V.C. to two distinguished engineer officers,
Captain (now Major-General) William Spottiswoode
Trevor and Lieutenant James Dundas. In that year
war broke out with the independent Bhotias, originating
in a quarrel over frontier territories in Assam,
and a British force under Major-General Sir Harry
Tombs, V.C., the hero of a little outpost skirmish at
Delhi, already recorded, was despatched to restore
order.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April a sharp engagement at
Dewangiri, down in the south-east corner of the little
hill-state, resulted in the Bhotias being driven out of
their position; but a remnant of them, some two
hundred in all, obstinately barricaded themselves in a
strongly-built, loopholed blockhouse. This little fortress,
standing at the summit of a rocky path, was the
key to the position, and it was essential that it should
not be held to serve as a rallying-point for the routed
enemy.</p>

<p>Turning to his Sikhs, General Tombs asked them
to make a dash for the walls and carry the place by
storm, but, courageous fighters though they were,
they looked at the rows of deadly loopholes and
stood still. They only waited for a leader, however.
With an “officer sahib” at their head, the big, black-bearded
Punjabis were ready for the most forlorn
of hopes. And they followed with alacrity when,
at Tombs’ call, Captain Trevor and Lieutenant Dundas
showed them the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking the path at a rush, the two officers gained
the wall of the blockhouse unscathed, and though
from every loophole came the crackle of a rifle they
began to scramble up the wall. The latter was
fourteen feet high, no mean obstacle to surmount;
but they got up at last, the captain leading, and found
themselves on a level with the roof of the blockhouse.
Between the top of the wall and the roof was an
opening not more than two feet wide. Through this
was their only chance of getting inside, and they
took it.</p>

<p>Head foremost they wriggled in through the narrow
hole, one after the other, and dropped like snakes
from the thatch into the midst of the surprised
garrison. At the first discharge of muskets both
of the intrepid officers were wounded, but the Sikhs
thronging in behind them quickly finished the
business. Within a few minutes the blockhouse
was swept clear.</p>

<p>The following year, 1866, saw us involved in
trouble with a West African tribe in the Gambia
district. A punitive expedition having been organised
under the command of Colonel D’Arcy, the Governor
of Gambia, the kingdom of Barra, in which the
turbulent tribe resided, was invaded. One of the
first actions in this campaign was the assault on the
stockaded town of Tubabecolong, and here Private
Samuel Hodge, of the 4th West India Regiment,
behaved with such gallantry that he became the
second man of colour to receive the V.C.</p>

<p>When the little force reached the town, Colonel
D’Arcy called for volunteers to break down the
stockade with axes. Hodge and another pioneer, who
was afterwards killed, answered the call, and plied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
their axes bravely in the face of the negroes’ fire
until a breach had been made. Through this the
regiment struggled, but the negroes had been reinforced,
and so strongly that they were able to beat
the besiegers off for a time.</p>

<p>Colonel D’Arcy relates that he found himself left
alone in the breach with only Hodge by him. Here
he kept firing at the negroes, while the big West
Indian, standing coolly at his side, conspicuous in
his scarlet uniform with white facings, supplied him
with loaded muskets. After a little time the rest
of the men re-formed and came once more to the
attack, whereupon Hodge went ahead again, breaking
a way for them through the bush-work defences.</p>

<p>To give his comrades a better chance of storming
the place, he at last ran round to the principal
entrance, drove off such of the negroes as thrust
themselves in his path, and forced open the two
great gates which had been barricaded from within.
Through these the West Indian Regiment charged
with their bayonets, and when they emerged at the
other side of the smoke-enveloped village they left
some hundreds of negroes dead and dying in their
wake.</p>

<p>Colonel D’Arcy had done great deeds of valour
that day, deeds which were suitably recognised later
by the merchants of Bathurst, who presented him
with a sword of honour, but he modestly disclaimed
the praise due to him. To Private Hodge, he said,
belonged the chief honours of the attack, and at the
close of the action, before the whole regiment, he
saluted the proud pioneer as “the bravest man in the
corps.”</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence it was in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
quarter of Africa that, twenty-six years later, the
third coloured man to be decorated won his V.C.
This was Corporal William James Gordon, also of
the West Indian Regiment. His act of special
gallantry was to save his officer (Major Madden)
from certain death at the storming of the town of
Toniataba, on the Gambia. Gordon thrust himself
between the major and the enemy’s rifle barrels as
they were suddenly poked out of the loopholes at
the officer’s back, receiving a bullet through his lungs
that went within an ace of killing him.</p>

<p>The other notable Crosses of the sixties were
awarded for deeds of bravery that necessitated the
issue of an additional Royal Warrant to cover deeds
performed not in action but “under circumstances of
extreme danger, such as the occurrence of a fire
on board ship, or of the foundering of a vessel at
sea, or under any other circumstances in which,
through the courage and devotion displayed, life or
public property may be saved.” By this special
provision a brave Irishman, Timothy O’Hea by name,
a private in the Rifle Brigade, was awarded the
V.C., together with Dr. Campbell Douglas, and four
privates of the South Wales Borderers, then styled
the 24th Regiment.</p>

<p>O’Hea’s exploit was performed at a railway siding
between Quebec and Montreal in June 1866, while
he was acting as one of an escort in charge of an
ammunition van. To everybody’s alarm a fire broke
out, enveloping the car in flames and smoke. Inside
were kegs of powder and cases of ammunition, which,
did they ignite, would cause a most terrible explosion.</p>

<p>While the others hesitated O’Hea snatched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
keys from the sergeant’s hand, opened the door of
the van and called for volunteers to bring him water
and a ladder. The latter was quickly procured, and
standing on this the plucky private emptied bucketful
after bucketful upon the burning wood. It was
a touch-and-go business, as the tongues of flame
shot out every now and then, coming dangerously
near to the powder kegs, but O’Hea stuck to his
post and he fought the fire under.</p>

<p>Though the Rifle Brigade has fourteen Crosses to
its credit, won in the Crimea, in India, and in South
Africa, I rather fancy that not one of them was
gained in circumstances of more deadly peril, and
his comrades were well pleased when Private Timothy
O’Hea’s name went to swell the proud list of V.C.
heroes. O’Hea, it may be added, met with a sad
fate in after years. He was lost in the Australian
bush, and never heard of again.</p>

<p>Dr. Douglas and the four men of the 24th
Regiment referred to&mdash;Privates Murphy, Cooper,
Bell, and Griffiths&mdash;earned their distinction at the
Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, in May of
1869.</p>

<p>A small expedition had been sent thither to
ascertain the fate of the captain and crew of the
<i>Assam Valley</i>, who, it had been reported, had
fallen victims to the natives. The graves of the
unfortunate men were found on the Little Andaman,
but when the search party returned to the shore
they found themselves cut off from their ship by a
tremendous high-running surf.</p>

<p>Their predicament having been observed, Dr.
Douglas with the four privates named manned a gig
and pulled in to their rescue. The first attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to get through the breakers half swamped the boat,
but a second attempt enabled them to save five men.
On the third and last trip the remaining twelve
members of the party were safely got off.</p>

<p>To read the bare official account of the affair is
to gain but a poor impression of the bravery displayed
by Dr. Douglas and his helpers. For a proper understanding
of the daring nature of the deed one must
have seen the immense surf rollers thundering on
to the beach, and have appreciated the very slender
chances of living through the boiling waters that a
man would have if capsized from a boat. It was
no ordinary rescue, and all five nobly earned their
Crosses.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">NEW ZEALAND.&mdash;FIGHTING THE MAORIS.</span></h2>

<p>The years 1860 to 1865 witnessed a very
stubborn war in New Zealand between the
British and the Maoris, the original natives of the
country. Many causes combined to make this war
unduly long. In the first place the importance of
the outbreak was underestimated, and the small
force already in the islands was considered strong
enough to cope with it; secondly, it was forgotten,
or overlooked, that the Maoris, although incorrigibly
lazy in times of peace, were a race of born fighters,
to whom war was almost the chief end of existence;
and thirdly, there was the difficult nature of the
country itself, with its many forests and swamps,
and miles on miles of dense, tangled bush. The odds
were all in the Maoris’ favour at the outset.</p>

<p>For many years we had been at peace with the
natives, a treaty having been signed by which we
bound ourselves to respect the chiefs territorial
rights. By 1860, however, a good deal of friction
had arisen over purchases of land by the colonists,
it being claimed by the Maoris that some of these
transactions took place without the full consent of
all the parties interested.</p>

<p>Especially was this the case in the transfer of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
piece of land at Taranaki, in the Northern Island.
It was only a small plot that was in dispute, but
the Waikato tribe who claimed possession would not
be pacified, and made a desperate resistance when
an attempt was made to oust them. Their success
in repulsing the few British troops sent against them
incited the tribe and their friends to proceed still
further. Old feuds were now revived, and the
insurrection at Taranaki quickly spread into a
general movement against the colonists, which in turn
resolved itself into a wholesale rebellion of the Maori
race.</p>

<p>In the fighting that ensued twelve Victoria
Crosses were gained, mostly for gallant rescues of
wounded men struck down in the bush or in the
pahs, the native palisade-fortified villages. The
Maoris have always been exceptionally cruel to their
prisoners in war, and the knowledge that a fallen
foe would receive no mercy at their hands spurred
our soldiers to make every effort to save a wounded
comrade.</p>

<p>One of the first Crosses to be won fell to Colour-Sergeant
John Lucas, of the 40th Regiment (the
South Lancashires). Early in 1861 he was fighting
up in the Taranaki district, near to the Huirangi
Bush. During one afternoon, while out skirmishing,
he and his party were suddenly subjected to a terribly
fierce fire from a hidden enemy. Men began to drop
quickly as the bullets pinged across the ravine, and
Lieutenant Rees fell badly wounded.</p>

<p>The officer having been carried to the rear, Lucas
stood guard over the other wounded, towards whom
the Maoris, breaking cover for the first time, made
an ugly rush. The colour-sergeant had several rifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
at hand, and adopting savage tactics, he got behind
a tree, only showing himself to neatly “pot” an
enemy. It was one man against a hundred; but, like
Private McManus in “Dhoolie Square,” he made himself
properly respected by the natives, and he held his
position until a reinforcement arrived to relieve him
of his charge.</p>

<p>A more exciting experience fell to the lot of a
sergeant of the York and Lancaster Regiment (the
old 65th) two years later. While in action with
a large body of Maoris both his superior officers,
Captain Swift and Lieutenant Butler, were wounded,
and the duty of withdrawing the little force devolved
upon him.</p>

<p>Sergeant Edward McKenna, who had a strong
strain of Irish blood in him, showed himself the man
for the occasion. The district was a broken and
rugged piece of country near Camerontown, and
swarmed with Maoris. If he wished to save his
officers’ lives and the lives of the whole detachment, he
had to act boldly.</p>

<p>Accordingly, leaving Corporal Ryan and three or
four men to protect the wounded captain and lieutenant,
and relying on the main body of the troops
soon finding them, he went slap-dash at the Maoris
on the hill in front of him. The charge scattered
the natives to a safe distance. Then, night coming
on, McKenna and his party camped in a convenient
spot in the bush. Very soon, however, this position
became unsafe. So back along the bush path they
trailed, firing at their invisible enemy as they went,
and having some other wounded now thrown on their
hands.</p>

<p>Owing to the darkness and the intricacies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
bush, the sergeant eventually lost his way, and, as he
said afterwards, there was nothing to do but to sit
down and wait for daylight. So all through the
night they squatted on the ground, McKenna mounting
guard with ears alert for the faintest sound of an
enemy; but fortunately none came. And in the
morning he had the satisfaction of leading his party
back to camp to report that only one was killed and
two were missing out of the thirty-eight men he had
manœuvred so skilfully.</p>

<p>Sergeant McKenna received a warm word of commendation
in the despatches from General Cameron,
the Commander-in-Chief, for that piece of business,
together with the Victoria Cross, the same honour
falling to Corporal Ryan, whose devotion to Captain
Swift, however, failed to save that gallant officer’s
life. Several of the others who figured prominently
in the affair were rewarded with the Distinguished
Conduct Medal.</p>

<p>Two very brilliant individual exploits that I may
note here won the V.C. for Major C. Heaphy of the
Auckland Militia, and Lieutenant-Colonel (afterwards
Major-General Sir) John Carstairs McNeill, of the
107th Regiment.</p>

<p>Major Heaphy was engaged in a skirmish with
Maoris on the banks of the Mangapiko River, Auckland,
when a wounded private tumbled into the midst of a
party of natives concealed in a hollow. Without a
moment’s hesitation the major leaped down after him.
Though wounded himself, with a dozen shot-holes in
his clothes and cap, he stuck by his man, and in time
got him safely away.</p>

<p class="caption">REINING IN HIS HORSE, HE TURNED TO CATCH VOSPER’S …
AND HELPED THE ORDERLY TO REMOUNT.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_137">Page 137.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The story of Colonel McNeill’s rescue is the story
of a ride for life which finds a close parallel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
deed for which Lord William Beresford gained the
V.C. in Zululand, as will be told hereafter. The
colonel was returning from Te Awamuta, whither he
had been sent on special duty, with two orderlies,
Privates Gibson and Vosper, both of the Colonial
Defence Force, when a body of the enemy was descried
some distance ahead. Despatching Gibson to the
nearest camp (at Ohanpu) for assistance, he rode a
little way up the road to the summit of a hill to
reconnoitre.</p>

<p>As McNeill, with Vosper by his side, trotted on,
unsuspecting any ambush, keen eyes watched them
from the thick ferns that bordered the road, and
presently some fifty Maoris sprang out to intercept
them. The moment the natives appeared the two
horsemen wheeled and galloped back down the hill.
They got a flying start, but an unlucky step into a
hole brought Vosper’s horse to his knees, sending his
rider head over heels into the ferns.</p>

<p>Then the colonel did a plucky thing. Reining in
his horse, he turned to catch Vosper’s, which was
galloping in the opposite direction, and leading it
back helped the orderly to remount. He was just in
the nick of time. A few seconds later, and the Maoris
would have been on them. As it was, only a mad
gallop at top speed carried them clear out of
range of the bullets that whistled round them.</p>

<p>Vosper spoke nothing but the plain truth when he
said that he owed his life entirely to his colonel; for
he could not have caught his horse, on foot as he was,
and the Maoris would have made short work of him.</p>

<p>The New Zealand War was brought to a close in
1864 by General Sir Trevor Chute, who broke the
Maori power and stamped out the rebellion. Four or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
five years later there were renewed disturbances,
massacres of settlers and raids upon outlying farms,
but these were isolated cases. Since 1870 the
natives have been content to live peaceably under the
British rule.</p>

<p>In 1864, a few months before the Maori chiefs
gave in their submission, a memorable fight took place
near Tauranga, Auckland, memorable for the disgrace
which it brought upon a British regiment, and for the
act of heroism which gained the V.C. for an Army
surgeon and a bluejacket. The story of it is as
follows.</p>

<p>On the peninsula of Te Papa, in the Poverty Bay
district of East Auckland, the Maoris had entrenched
themselves in a very strong position. They had built
a long stockade along the narrow strip of land connecting
the peninsula with the coast, at Tauranga,
with rifle-pits extending almost the whole length.
This formidable fort was known as the Gate Pah,
because it commanded the entrance to that region.</p>

<p>The natives chose the place for their stronghold
wisely. The Gate Pah was guarded by great swamps
on both sides, which rendered a flank attack impossible.
The assault must come either from the front or
rear. Fully alive to the difficulties of the task,
General Cameron proceeded to attack this position on
April 28th with a force of infantry (the 68th and
43rd Regiments) and two hundred seamen from the
warships off the coast.</p>

<p>While some of the Naval Brigade and the 68th
Regiment (the Durham Light Infantry) stole round at
night to the rear of the stockade, the artillery the
next morning opened fire in front, pouring shot and
shell unceasingly for eight and a half hours into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pah. The Maoris responded at first with a brisk rifle-fire,
but after a time this stopped. Dead silence
reigned over the stockade, as if most of its inmates
had been killed. Believing this to be the case, the
43rd Foot (the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, known
popularly as “the Light Bobs” and “the Fighting
Forty-third”) moved forward with a number of bluejackets
to carry the place by storm.</p>

<p>That the fight was practically over seemed evident
from the ease with which the troops drove out the few
Maoris remaining in the pah. But the wily natives
had laid a subtle ambush, to the success of which
a regrettable accident contributed. As the Oxfordshires
and the naval men followed up the pursuit in
the gathering darkness, the detachment sent previously
to the rear began firing into the medley of Maoris and
British. Considerable confusion was caused, and both
the 43rd and the sailors were ordered to retire.</p>

<p>This was done promptly, the troops regaining the
shelter of the stockade. Here they had no fear of
danger, for the place was apparently deserted, and
only the fugitive Maoris, who had rallied, menaced
them. They wandered about the pah in careless
disorder, some even laying aside their rifles, when
suddenly from the ground beneath them a whole host
of native warriors appeared, rising like apparitions in
their midst. In cunningly concealed holes and rifle-pits,
covered over with branches and pieces of turf,
the Maoris had awaited the coming of the <i lang="mi">pakehas</i>.</p>

<p>Before this mysterious ghostly enemy, who fell upon
them with rifle and war-club, the soldiers and sailors
fled in wild confusion. A perfect panic set in, and
every man sought to save his own skin.</p>

<p>It is difficult to locate the blame in instances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this kind. British troops and British officers have
been seized with panic before under the stress of
great excitement, and the same thing will probably
happen again. Human courage is, after all, an uncertain
quantity; an admittedly brave man has more
than once failed at a critical moment through lack
of nerve or some less explicable reason and turned
coward. Was there not the well-known case of a
lieutenant-colonel (his name is charitably concealed)
in the Indian Mutiny, whose conduct Sir Colin
Campbell characterised in a vigorous despatch as
“pusillanimous and imbecile to the last degree,”
before dismissing him from the service? This officer
had a distinguished record, but a momentary weakness
led him to surrender an important position without
cause and blasted his whole career.</p>

<p>In the panic that set in when the hideous tattooed
faces of the Maoris rose up so uncannily from the
depths of the earth the slaughter of our men was
terrific. Officers and privates alike fell easy victims
to the well-armed natives. Then it was that Assistant-Surgeon
William G. N. Manley, R.A., and Samuel
Mitchell, captain of the foretop of H.M.S. <i>Harrier</i>,
won glory for themselves by a gallant rescue.</p>

<p>Commander Hay, of the Naval Brigade, fell badly
wounded at the first discharge, and lay groaning in
the middle of the pah. All were in full flight, but
seeing his officer helpless on the ground Mitchell ran
to his side, picked him up in his strong arms and bore
him outside the stockade. Here he found Dr. Manley,
who oblivious to the bullets that fell thickly around,
bound up the commander’s wounds. That done, he
and Mitchell conveyed the dying man back to camp.</p>

<p>Not content with having done that duty, the brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
surgeon returned voluntarily to the pah and coolly
set about tending the wounded. They lay there in
heaps, alas! and he had all his work to do to get them
removed to a place of safety. The fire which swept
the stockade is said to have been terrible, yet not a
scratch did he receive the whole time, and he was the
last to leave the pah. Both Dr. Manley and Mitchell
were awarded the Cross for Valour some months later,
for the heroism that in part redeemed the Gate Pah
disaster.</p>

<p>As for the Fighting Forty-third, whose colours bore
the names of Corunna, Badajoz, Vittoria, and many
another famous fight of the Peninsular War, the
memory of that night of panic rankled deep in their
minds. They swore a solemn vow that the next time
they came to grips with the Maoris the enemy should
remember it. It was at Tuaranga that they got their
chance, on June 21st of the same year, and on this
day one of their officers, Captain Frederick Augustus
Smith, won the Cross for leaping into a rifle-pit and
routing a number of the Maoris single-handed.</p>

<p>This made the second V.C. that the 43rd won, by the
way, the first having been given in 1859 to Private
Addison for saving the life of an officer in India.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">IN ASHANTI BUSH AND MALAY JUNGLE.</span></h2>

<p>It is a big leap from Maoriland to West Africa, but
it is there, to Ashanti, that we must go to see
how the next Crosses on the roll were won.</p>

<p>Ashanti, as the map shows, is in the Upper Guinea
district, immediately inland of the Gold Coast.
Seventy thousand square miles in extent, it is thickly
covered with forests of mahogany, ebony, and other
valuable hardwood trees, except where it is given up
to vast mangrove swamps that are no good to anybody.
Its people are pure negroes, thick-lipped, flat-nosed,
with woolly hair and projecting jaws. They are
a savage, cruel race, fetish-worshippers like most of
the tribes in West Africa, who have been notorious
for the revolting form of their religious rites.</p>

<p>Until the custom of making human sacrifices was
put down with a strong hand by Great Britain,
Coomassie, the capital, was as much a City of Blood as
was the ill-famed Benin, a very different place from
the town of to-day, with its wide, regular streets and
stuccoed houses painted red and white.</p>

<p>With this country of Ashanti we have come repeatedly
into conflict from the early days of last
century, when trading stations became established on
the coast. The Dutch, too, found their way thither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with the same object in view, and out of the rivalry
between them and us trouble arose that came to a
head in 1872. In that year the Dutch traders who
had established themselves on the Gold Coast were
bought out by us, their possessions being transferred
to this country in return for some land concessions
in the island of Sumatra. To this arrangement King
Coffee of Ashanti took exception, as he lost thereby
certain annual tributes which the Dutch had hitherto
paid him, and by way of showing his resentment he
carried off several missionaries and attacked our allies
the Fantis.</p>

<p>It was necessary to bring King Coffee and his
turbulent subjects to reason, so in September 1873
Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent out to Ashanti with
an expedition. The task was no easy one, for before
Coomassie was reached the troops had to fight their
way through the bush, and the African bush is not
to be treated lightly, with its tangled masses of
vegetation, dark belts of forest, rivers and morasses.
Moreover, the campaign had to be completed before
the hot season came on, when the terrors of pestilence
and fever would have to be faced.</p>

<p>That Sir Garnet Wolseley did accomplish the task
set him is a matter of history. By February of the
following year King Coffee was forced to make peace,
one of the terms being that he should discontinue
human sacrifices.</p>

<p>In this five months’ campaign four Victoria Crosses
were won, and of these the first two fell to Lieutenant
the Hon. Edric Gifford (the present Lord Gifford) and
Lance-Sergeant Samuel McGaw of the 42nd Regiment.
The latter earned his distinction at the battle of
Amoaful, the first victory of any consequence, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Ashantis were completely routed. At that
engagement McGaw led his company through the
dense bush in splendid style, himself fighting all
through the day, although suffering from a very severe
wound received at the commencement of the battle.</p>

<p>Lord Gifford’s Cross was won for a long series of
useful services rendered to his commander, though
more particularly for his exceptional bravery at the
taking of the town of Becquah on February 1st, 1874.
At the beginning of the campaign (his first taste of
active service, by the way) he organised a body of
scouts, loyal natives who knew the country well and
could be relied on. With this little band he ranged
ahead of the army, hanging upon the enemy’s skirts,
so to speak, and ferreting out their intentions by
means of his spies. It was dangerous, highly
dangerous, work, for it meant thrusting himself almost
into the very arms of a foe who showed no mercy in
war.</p>

<p>“It is no exaggeration,” says the official account,
“to say that since the Adansi Hills were passed he
daily carried his life in his hands in the performance
of his most hazardous duty.” With no other white
man by him, Lieutenant Gifford captured many
prisoners, and the information he was able to procure
for his chief was naturally of the utmost value.</p>

<p>If he carried his life in his hand while out scouting
there is no doubt that he did the same at the taking
of Becquah. Gifford and his scouts were through
the stockade and into the town some time before the
troops stormed it, and were in the thick of the
fighting throughout. Of that day’s work, as well
as of the scouting in the bush, Sir Garnet took full
note when sending his despatches, and the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lieutenant of the South Wales Borderers saw himself
duly gazetted.</p>

<p>Major Reginald Sartorius (now a Major-General)
is another V.C. man who gained his decoration in
far-off Ashanti. At the attack on Abogoo he bravely
risked his life to save a wounded Haussa sergeant-major
who had fallen under a heavy fire; and he is
also famous for a most plucky ride through the
heart of the enemy’s country to establish connection
between the main body and Captain Glover’s column.</p>

<p>The name of Sartorius, it may be mentioned, is
like that of Gough in figuring twice in the honoured
list of V.C.’s, and in each case it is two brothers who
have thus won double distinction. Major-General
Euston Henry Sartorius received his Cross for an
exploit in Afghanistan, mention of which will be found
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Next on my list of Ashanti heroes comes Colonel
Mark Sever Bell, a distinguished Engineer officer of
many campaigns. The battle at Ordahsu in January
of 1874 saw him in the very fore-front of the British
line alone with a working gang of Fantis, digging a
trench. A severe fire from both front and rear
played upon them, and&mdash;what is said to be an almost
unparalleled incident in warfare&mdash;they were not
protected by a covering party.</p>

<p>The Fantis, to whose qualities Miss Kingsley has
paid high tribute, are not warriors of the first order,
however faithful they may be as servants; and that
Lieutenant Bell (to give him the rank he then bore)
got them to work in such circumstances was due
solely to his fearless and courageous bearing. When
he came in from the trench it was to receive the
generous compliments of his chief, Colonel Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
McLeod, who had considered his chances of getting
back alive extremely slight. The V.C. followed at
the latter officer’s recommendation.</p>

<p>Although it is not strictly in chronological order,
I may note here that in 1900 there was again trouble
in Ashanti, which resulted in two more V.C.’s being
won. Of these one went to Captain Melliss, of the
Indian Staff Corps, and the other to Sergeant (now
Captain) John Mackenzie, of the Seaforths.</p>

<p>Mackenzie’s gallantry was most marked. At the
attack on Dompoassi in June he found the fight
progressing too slowly for him. He had been working
two Maxim guns under a hot fire (being wounded
while doing so), but the enemy held their position as
obstinately as ever. So to “finish the business” the
sergeant volunteered to clear the stockades, and at
the head of a body of Haussas he charged boldly
upon them. The blacks followed his lead with
spirit; before their headlong rush the Ashantis fled
into the bush, and shortly after Dompoassi was ours.</p>

<p class="tb">Just a year after the Ashanti trouble there was an
outbreak in the Malay Peninsula which called for a
punitive expedition. The little brown men of Perak,
own brothers to the head-hunting Dyaks of Borneo,
had to be taught the lesson that Great Britain will
not tolerate outrages upon her subjects.</p>

<p>With the column that marched up through the
jungle upon the Malay strongholds was Major
George Nicholas Channer, of the Bengal Staff Corps,
who had joined the Indian Army just too late to
take part in the suppression of the Mutiny, but in
time to see service in the Umbeyla campaign of
1863. Both here and in the Looshai country a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
years later he showed himself a dashing leader of
native troops, and the 1st Ghurkas were by no means
ill-pleased when they learned that he was attached
to them for the Perak expedition. Major Channer,
for his part, was glad of the chance of seeing
another fight, though he little guessed that it was to
afford him an opportunity of winning the V.C. and
covering himself with glory. Yet such proved to be
the case.</p>

<p>On its way northwards the force eventually reached
the Bukit Putus Pass, the most difficult part of the
journey to be traversed. All around was dense
jungle and impenetrable forest, in which a host of
Malays lay in wait to harass the troops. How
numerous were the enemy could not be ascertained,
nor how strong were their defences, and it was
important that information on these points should
be obtained or the column might blunder into an
ambush. Major Channer was selected as the officer
best fitted to procure this intelligence, and with a
small party of his wiry little Ghurkas he struck
off one day into the wilds.</p>

<p>Making a long detour, he worked his way round to
the rear of the enemy’s position without any mishap.
Here he found that the Malays were strongly posted
in a solid log-fort, loopholed on every side and
surrounded by a formidable bamboo palisade. As he
peered at it through the trees a number of black
forms flitted busily to and fro, showing that the fort
was well garrisoned.</p>

<p>Channer had learned enough to see that the troops
would have considerable difficulty in carrying the
position, and might well have returned to make his
report. But he was not content with merely having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
done so much. He determined to make a closer
inspection to discover, if possible, where was the
weakest spot in the defences.</p>

<p>At night, therefore, leaving his men hidden within
call in the jungle, he crept stealthily up through the
long grass to the outer stockade. All was still, for
the Malays had mounted no guard on that side of the
fort. Raising himself cautiously to his knees, he
peeped between the bamboo poles and saw that the
garrison was all intent on cooking its supper. At
once a daring idea came into his head. Quickly
dropping back into the long grass, the major
wormed his way towards the spot where his faithful
Ghurkas were waiting and beckoned them to join
him. Then he explained that he intended to take
the Malays by surprise and rush the fort.</p>

<p>The Ghurkas were gleefully ready for a job like
this, and at the word followed him noiselessly to the
point in the palisade whence he had observed the
unsuspecting Malays. A quick scramble over and
the whole party were inside. The first man who
offered resistance Major Channer shot dead with his
revolver. The rest stood aghast at the unexpected
spectacle of a white officer in their midst, and before
they could recover from their astonishment the
Ghurkas in their neat green uniforms and little round
caps were among them, using their keen <i>kukris</i> with
deadly effect. The surprise was complete. The
Malays, ignorant of the numbers of their assailants,
abandoned the fort and fled precipitately into the
jungle.</p>

<p>A message to the main body soon brought up the
troops, when the fort was destroyed, leaving the way
clear for the march to be continued. But for Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Channer’s bold attack the fort would have had to
be carried by a bayonet charge, as it was secure from
the big guns, and much loss of life must have been
caused. His act, therefore, was one of the greatest
service to the expedition.</p>

<p>The gallant major, who got his Cross a few months
later, afterwards served with considerable distinction
under Lord Roberts in Afghanistan, and commanded
a brigade in the Black Mountain (Hazara) expedition
of 1888. He died at his home in North Devon only
at the end of last year, a General and a C.B.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW SOME AFGHAN CROSSES WERE WON.</span></h2>

<p>The war which broke out in Afghanistan in 1878
and lasted two years was of a far more serious
nature than the campaign in Ashanti which I have
just dealt with. It was at bottom a struggle to assert
our supremacy on the Indian frontier, where Russia
was beginning to menace us, and on its result hung
the fortunes of a large part of Asia. Before I tell
of how several notable V.C.’s were gained in the
hill-fighting round Candahar and Cabul it is necessary
to say a few words about the war itself, in order that
we may properly understand the situation.</p>

<p>Trouble over Afghanistan began very early in the
nineteenth century, but Great Britain maintained a
firm hold over the country and its Amir until the
advent to the throne of Shere Ali Khan. This
turbulent ruler was a very go-ahead monarch indeed.
He organised a splendid army, well-drilled and well-equipped
with modern arms, and spent some years in
military preparations which could have had only
one object&mdash;the ultimate overthrow of British influence
in that part of the world.</p>

<p>That Russia and Russian money was behind all this
has been made very clear. The go-ahead Shere Ali
went ahead so far that he made overtures to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Muscovite Government and received a Russian mission
at Cabul. When Lord Roberts reached the capital
after his victorious march he found, he says, “Afghan
Sirdars and officers arrayed in Russian pattern uniforms,
Russian money in the treasury, Russian wares
sold in the bazaars; and, although the roads leading
to Central Asia were certainly no better than
those leading to India, Russia had taken more
advantage of them than we had to carry on commercial
dealings with Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>Our first move was to establish a British mission
at Cabul, but this met with failure. Then Shere Ali,
after abdicating in favour of his son, Yakoub Khan,
conveniently died, and our prospects improved. A
mission, at the head of which was Sir Louis Cavagnari,
was received at the capital, and all seemed to be going
well when the civilised world was startled by the
news that Cavagnari and all with him had been
massacred.</p>

<p>Without any loss of time, Lord Roberts (then
Major-General Frederick Sleigh Roberts) started from
India with an army to avenge this atrocity. After
some stiff fighting, he reached Cabul and deposed the
Amir. There were left, however, a number of minor
chiefs who continued to stir up trouble. Of these the
leading spirit was the ex-Amir’s brother, Ayoub Khan,
who inflicted a defeat upon us at the battle of
Maiwand and proceeded to invest Candahar.</p>

<p>Upon this followed Roberts’ historic march from
Cabul to Candahar which won him a baronetcy and
a G.C.B. In this descent upon Ayoub Khan he
utterly routed the Afghan leader and quieted the
country. A new Amir, Abdur Rahman (nephew of
Shere Ali) was now installed, with the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
proviso that Afghanistan should have no foreign
relations with any power except the Government of
India, and the British army was withdrawn.</p>

<p class="tb">The first V.C. of the campaign was gained by
Captain John Cook, of the Bengal Staff Corps, for a
singularly gallant rescue of a brother-officer. It was
during the month of December 1878, while General
Roberts was on his way to Cabul, whither he was
escorting Cavagnari’s mission. There had been
several encounters with the Afghans, for the latter
had shown themselves hostile all along the line
of route, and a decisive engagement was fought at
the Peiwar Kotal, in the Kuram district. (A “kotal,”
it may be explained, is the highest point in a mountain
pass.)</p>

<p>At this fight a slender column was detached from
the main body and sent round to force a position in
the Spingawi Kotal, where the enemy had entrenched
themselves. The attack was made at night, and
although, through the treachery of some Pathans with
the column, the alarm was given, the Afghans were
driven out.</p>

<p>Side by side Highlanders and Ghurkas, who had
been good friends ever since they fought together in
the Mutiny, charged up the steep rocky hillside,
through a forest of pines, and carried one stockade
after another. As the enemy broke before them,
Major Galbraith, Assistant-Adjutant-General to the
force, was suddenly attacked by a powerful Afghan.
The major’s revolver missed fire when he aimed, and
it is more than probable that he would have been
shot down at once had not Captain Cook rushed to
his rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A blow from his sword having diverted the
Afghan’s attention, Cook threw himself bodily upon
the man and closed with him. They struggled together
thus for some little time, locked in a deadly
embrace, the Afghan endeavouring vainly to use his
bayonet and the captain his sword. Then, gripping his
opponent by the throat, Cook fell with him to the
ground, only to have his sword-arm seized by the
Afghan’s strong teeth. Another roll over gave the
latter a slight advantage, but only for a moment.
At this critical juncture a little Ghurka ran up and
shot the fellow through the head.</p>

<p>Captain Cook was decorated for this exploit on the
Queen’s Birthday in the May following, at a grand
parade at Kuram, but he did not live long to wear
his Cross. He died of a severe wound twelve
months later.</p>

<p>In March of 1879 a gallant little action was
fought near Maidanah of which scant mention is made
outside official records. It may be fittingly recorded
here, as it was the means of bringing distinction to a
young captain of Engineers who now writes himself
Lieut.-General Edward Pemberton Leach, V.C., C.B.</p>

<p>Leach was out on survey duty in the Maidanah
district with an escort of Rattray’s Sikhs under the
command of Lieutenant Barclay. While thus engaged
a body of Afghans appeared in close proximity and
endeavoured to cut them off. The Sikhs having
fallen slowly back, under orders, the Afghans became
more bold, and in still larger numbers pressed nearer.
Then there was a sudden rush, a volley, and Lieutenant
Barclay fell shot in the breast.</p>

<p>To get the wounded officer back to camp in safety
was Leach’s first thought. The Afghans must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
kept at a safe distance. With all the Sikhs, therefore,
save the two or three needed to attend to
Barclay, he formed up and charged with bayonets
fixed straight into the oncoming enemy.</p>

<p>They were a score or so against a hundred, but
desperate men take desperate risks. Leach himself
was immediately attacked by four Afghans, two of
whom he shot in quick succession. The third
grappled with him, but another shot from the unerring
revolver settled him, and the captain turned
to meet his fourth assailant. He was not a moment
too soon. The Afghan had slipped round to attack
him from the rear, and as Leach’s left arm went up
in defence it received on it the blow from an Afghan
knife that was aimed at his back.</p>

<p>A slash from his sword laid the Pathan low. Then
wounded as he was, with blood streaming fast from
his arm, the captain dashed on into the mêlée, and
gathering his men together for another fierce charge
sent the enemy tumbling backwards in confusion.
But the little company was not even then out of
danger. The retreat led them along a narrow rocky
road, from the sides of which the Afghans continued
to pepper them, and a last charge was necessary to
scatter them. Fortunately, just after this a cavalry
troop, attracted by the noise of firing, came up and
relieved them.</p>

<p>Captain Leach was promptly awarded the Cross for
Valour for his bravery, but though he had succeeded
in saving the party from certain annihilation, his
satisfaction was clouded over by one great sorrow.
Poor Lieutenant Barclay died soon afterwards from
his wound.</p>

<p>The next V.C., the story of which I have to tell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is that of Lieutenant Hamilton,&mdash;“Hamilton of the
Guides,”&mdash;whose brilliant career was cut all too short
at Cabul in the massacre of Cavagnari’s ill-fated
mission. Having joined Brigadier-General Gough’s
force, which was keeping clear the line of communication
between Jellalabad and Cabul, Lieutenant Hamilton
saw plenty of fighting with the hill-tribes in the
vicinity. At Futtehabad, in April 1879, there was
an engagement with a considerable body of Afghans,
and in this fight he made himself conspicuous.</p>

<p>At the moment that the scale of victory was
turning in our favour, the Guides, led by their beloved
commander, Major Wigram Battye, charged into the
Afghan ranks. Battye fell shot through the heart at
the first volley, and the leadership devolved on
Hamilton, who led them on, more fierce than ever.
In the mêlée that now ensued Dowlut Ram, a sowar
riding by the lieutenant’s side, was bowled over and
instantly threatened with death from three Afghan
knives. Wheeling his horse, Hamilton cut his way
to the fallen man’s side, dragged him from beneath
his dead horse, and carried him off right under the
enemy’s nose.</p>

<p>For this act he was recommended for the Cross,
but to everyone’s disappointment it was not awarded
him. Only after he had fallen beneath Afghan
swords at Cabul, five months later, was his heroism
acknowledged. Then followed the tardy announcement
that had he lived her Majesty would have been
pleased to confer the honour of the Victoria Cross
upon him.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s end was an heroic one. Early one
September morning in 1879 the Residency at Cabul
in which Sir Louis Cavagnari and his staff had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
up their quarters was attacked and fired by the
Afghans. The only defenders of the place were the
Guides, a mere handful of men under Lieutenant
Hamilton’s command. Soon the building was stormed,
and Cavagnari with his suite brutally massacred.
Hamilton alone remained, the last Englishman left
alive in Cabul.</p>

<p>Driven from room to room, he and his men at last
reached the courtyard to make their last stand. In
vain did the Afghans call on the Guides to join
them, saying they had no quarrel with men of
their own race. The Guides were loyal to the oath
they had sworn. As one man they formed up
behind their gallant leader, dressed their ranks,
and flung wide</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The doors not all their valour could longer keep.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then with a cheer out they dashed at the horde
before them, in the mad endeavour to cut their way
through. It was a forlorn hope. The enemy closed
round them like a dark sea,</p>

<p>How Hamilton himself fell was learned afterwards
from the Afghans, who could appreciate such dauntless
courage as his. They said he fought like a lion at
bay, sweeping a space clear around him with his
sword; and it was only by the reckless sacrifice of
a few of their number, who threw themselves upon
him and were shot or sabred, that the rest were able
to pull him down. Then a dozen knives buried
themselves in his body, and all was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The record of the Afghan War teems with heroic
exploits, but only a few more can be touched on here.
There was, for instance, the gallant rescue of a
wounded Bengal Lancer at Dakka, by Lieutenant
Reginald Clare Hart (now a Lieut.-General and K.C.B.).
“I am going for the V.C. to-day!” he said to his
brother-officers on the morning of the engagement;
and he won it, after running some twelve hundred
yards under the Afghan fire to pull the disabled
sowar out of a river bed.</p>

<p>At about the same time Captain O’Moor Creagh
with a detachment of one hundred and fifty men held
off fifteen thousand Afghans who attacked him near
the village of Ram Dakka; a brilliant feat that was
only equalled by Captain Vousden, of the 5th Punjab
Cavalry, who some time later charged into a body of
four hundred of the enemy with simply <em>twelve</em> sowars
at his back, and dispersed them!</p>

<p>There were Crosses for both these brave captains,
just as there was one for Captain E. H. Sartorius
(brother of the Ashanti hero) for a dashing charge
which cleared a strong force of the enemy from the
Shah Juy hill at Tazi.</p>

<p>Mention of Sartorius recalls the somewhat similar
deeds which gained a V.C. for a distinguished major
of the 92nd Highlanders, who is now the popular
Field-Marshal Sir George Stewart White, G.C.B., etc.
On his Cross two dates figure, October 6, 1879, and
September 1, 1880. The first denotes the action at
Charasiah, where the Afghans were defeated, much to
the chagrin of the treacherous Amir Yakoub Khan,
who had laid plans for the complete annihilation of
the British army.</p>

<p>There was a hill to be taken, on which the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had mustered in large numbers, and at the word of
command two companies of the “Gay Gordons,” with
Major White at their head, breasted the slope and
raced up. The major was easily first. Leaving the
rest to follow, he tore ahead and bearded the Afghans
single-handed, shooting their leader dead with his
revolver. This act brought him high praise from
General Roberts, who went over the ground with him
next day and noted the difficulties that had to be
encountered.</p>

<p>On the second occasion Major White was with his
Gordons at Candahar, assisting in the rout of Ayoub
Khan. At an important stage of the battle a
desperate stand was made by the Afghans at the
Baba Wali Kotal, and it became necessary to storm
the position, or the wavering enemy would have time
to rally.</p>

<p>“Now, 92nd,” cried their leader, “just one charge
more to close the business!” The Gordons answered
with a shout, and accompanied by the 2nd Ghurkas
and 23rd Pioneers they streamed up the hill to carry
it with bayonets. As always, Major White was well
in front. He was the first to reach the guns, the next
man being Sepoy Inderbir Lama, who placed his rifle
on one of them and exclaimed proudly, “Captured in
the name of the 2nd Ghurkas!”</p>

<p>That charge did “close the business.” The Afghans
broke and fled, and the troops went on to capture
Ayoub Khan’s enormous camp with his artillery,
thirty-two pieces in all, among them being found two
of our Horse Artillery guns that had been taken at
Maiwand in July.</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without telling how
Padre Adams won his V.C. The only clergyman to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
have received the decoration, he stands in a unique
position, although, as I have said already, at least one
other Army chaplain deserved it.</p>

<p>The Rev. James William Adams, B.A. (to give him
his full title), was attached to the Cabul Field Force
and marched up to the Amir’s capital with the
troops when they went to avenge Cavagnari’s death.
Liking to be always at the front when any fighting
was going on, he acted as aide-de-camp to General
Roberts on several occasions, making himself very useful.
It was in this capacity that he was accompanying
Roberts when, on December 11th, 1879, the main
body of the force encountered Mahommed Jan’s army
near Sherpur and, owing to a miscarriage of plans,
was obliged to beat a temporary retreat.</p>

<p>In the retiring movement some of the guns were
in danger of falling into the Afghans’ hands, so a
troop of the 9th Lancers, with a few of the 14th
Bengal Lancers, made a gallant attempt to hold the
enemy in check. The charge was brilliant but
disastrous. Men and horses went down like ninepins,
many of them falling into a deep ditch, or nullah, in
which one or two of the guns had already come to
grief.</p>

<p>Seeing a wounded, dismounted man of the 9th
staggering towards him, Adams jumped off his charger
and tried to lift the poor fellow into the saddle, but
the animal, a very valuable mare, took fright and
bolted. Still supporting the lancer, the chaplain
helped him on his way to the rear, where some of his
comrades took him in charge.</p>

<p>Returning at once to the front, Adams observed
two more men of the 9th in the ditch who were in
difficulties. Their horses had rolled over on to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and they were struggling vainly to get free. The
advancing Afghans were now pretty close, and General
Roberts called out to the chaplain to look after himself;
but the “fighting parson,” as his men called him,
was a true hero. Leaping down into the ditch
without a moment’s hesitation, he splashed his way
through the mud and water to the lancers’ rescue.
A few strong pulls of his brawny arms (he was an
unusually powerful man) quickly released the imprisoned
men, and he had them safe on the top of
the bank ere the first of the Afghans had reached the
nullah.</p>

<p>Padre Adams had long been the idol of the men to
whom he ministered, and there was general rejoicing
in the Army when his name in due course appeared
in the <cite>Gazette</cite>. There was keen regret, too, some
years later when he bade farewell to the service
he loved, and returned home to settle down in a peaceful
Norfolk rectory.</p>

<p>It seems only the other day that his tall well-built
figure was to be met striding along the lanes round
Stow Bardolph and Downham Market, and it is hard
to realise that nearly three years have now passed
since death took “the V.C. parson” from our midst.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAIWAND.&mdash;A GUNNER’S STORY.</span></h2>

<p>The one disaster of the Afghan campaign of
1878-80 was the defeat of General Burrows’
force at Maiwand by an army of 25,000 men
under the leadership of Ayoub Khan himself.
It had been expected that the Amir would follow
a certain route on his way to Ghazni and Candahar,
and Burrows had been warned to be on the look-out.
That the British general failed to stay the Amir’s
progress when the two armies came into conflict at
Maiwand was due to the smallness of his force, which
numbered less than 3000 men; to the desertion of
a large number of native levies; and to the fact
that the native portion of the brigade got out of
hand soon after the fight had started, and impeded
the British troops.</p>

<p>Continuing his march after this signal victory,
Ayoub Khan proceeded to Candahar and commenced
the siege of that city. How he was speedily followed
by General Roberts and in turn defeated has been
already told.</p>

<p class="tb">The battle of Maiwand was fought on July 27th,
1880. Early on the morning of that day Burrows’
brigade, including the 66th Regiment, “the Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Howards,” and some Royal Horse Artillery, and
encumbered with a large number of camels, baggage
waggons, camp followers, etc., moved out from the
camp at Khushk-i-Nakhud. This position was about
forty miles from Candahar. The Afghan army was
to be intercepted at the village of Maiwand, eleven
miles away.</p>

<p>Riding with the guns of the Horse Artillery that
summer morning were two men, Sergeant Patrick
Mullane and Gunner James Collis, who were destined
to win no little glory in the somewhat inglorious
fight. They were by no means the only heroes of
Maiwand, for many stirring deeds were done that
day; but the slaughter was terrific, and of all who
earned the honour of the V.C. only these two survived.</p>

<p>As an example of the courage displayed by the
British troops the story may be told of how, when
our native infantry broke and fled before the Afghan
attack, the 66th Regiment was left alone to receive
the onset of the enemy. Such a small body of men
could do nothing, however valiantly they fought, and
very reluctantly they obeyed the order to fall back.
Following up their advantage, the Afghans now
pressed them more closely. In among the doomed
soldiers leapt the white-robed Pathans, stabbing and
slashing with their long knives until they succeeded
in breaking up the men into small parties, who could
be more easily cut down.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a little company of
the 66th, officers and men, gathered together for a
last stand in a little village some distance from
Maiwand. Surrounded by a yelling horde, they fired
volley after volley, but the return fire of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
gradually thinned their ranks. At length, so it is
recorded, ten privates and one officer alone remained.
Back to back stood the brave eleven, determined
never to give in, for the honour of the regiment and
their country. And one by one they dropped where
they stood, until, it is related, but one man remained
erect, facing his foes undaunted. One man against
some hundreds. Then the Afghan rifles spoke out
once more, and the last of that stricken remnant fell
with a bullet through his heart.</p>

<p>But it is of Mullane and Collis that I propose
to speak here, and of how they won their V.C.’s.
After the fortune of the battle was decided and the
stricken British brigade commenced its retreat to
Candahar the Royal Horse Artillery made many
gallant attempts to beat off the pursuing Afghans.
Indeed, but for the masterly way in which they
worked their guns, the losses on our side must have
been considerably greater than they were.</p>

<p>Sergeant Mullane stood by his gun on one of
these occasions, and after a round or two had been
fired helped to limber up smartly to follow the force.
As the gun moved on a driver was seen to fall. The
Afghans were tearing after the fugitives at full speed,
and the wounded man lay directly in their path.</p>

<p>Only a daring man would have ventured to turn
and face that fierce oncoming crowd; but “Paddy”
Mullane was that man. Racing back to where the
driver lay, he lifted him up in his arms and, being a
big strong fellow, quickly carried him out of the
enemy’s reach. It was a narrow squeak, however;
as he turned with his burden to make for his comrades,
the nearest Afghans were within a few yards of
him, and one or two wild shots whizzed by his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, while the retreat continued, Mullane
performed another gallant action, which was duly
noted on his Cross. Most of the troops, and
particularly the wounded, suffered terribly from
thirst in the glare of the sun, and it was impossible
to obtain drink from the hostile villages they passed
through.</p>

<p>At last Sergeant Mullane could stand the cries of
distress no longer. “I’m off to get some water,” he
announced briefly to his comrades, when they neared
another village. And, doubling to the nearest houses,
he managed to procure a good supply, with which
he ran hastily back, while the infuriated villagers
peppered him hotly. Fortunately for him their
marksmanship was none too good, and not a shot
struck him, though several went so close as to
make him realise the risk he had run.</p>

<p class="tb">Of how Gunner Collis bore himself in that retreat
from Maiwand we have been told in his own words,
and I cannot do better than follow the account he gives.
He was limber gunner, he says, in his battery, and
when an Afghan shell killed four of the gunners and
Sergeant Wood, only three were left to work the
piece. Taking the sergeant’s place, he went on firing,
but was soon almost borne down by panic-stricken
fugitives, who threw themselves both under and on
the gun.</p>

<p>On the native infantry and cavalry breaking up in
confusion the guns limbered up and fell back at a
gallop for some two thousand yards. Here another
two rounds were fired, but again the order came to
retire, for the enemy were advancing rapidly. A
mounted Afghan even caught up with the gun on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
which Collis sat and slashed at him fiercely as he
passed. The sword cut the gunner over the left eyebrow.
As the Afghan wheeled and rode at him again
Collis raised his carbine, and at about five yards’
range let drive. The shot struck the sowar on the
chest, causing him to fall from his horse. In doing
so some money rattled out of his turban, and Collis
relates that Trumpeter Jones, R.H.A., jumped off
his horse and picked it up.</p>

<p>Dusk now came fast upon the fugitives, and having
stepped aside at a village to try and secure some
water, Collis lost his gun. He accordingly attached
himself to No. 2, sticking to it all the way to
Candahar.</p>

<p>By the wayside, as they went along, lay many
wounded. As many of these as he could the gallant
gunner picked up and placed on his gun. He
collected ten altogether, every one a 66th man,
except a colonel whom he did not know. Presently
the wounded began to beg for water, and like Mullane,
Collis could not bear to hear their cries without
making an effort to satisfy them.</p>

<p>At a village near Kokeran, the next day, he made
a dash for some water, which he was successful in
obtaining. Here, he records, he saw Lieutenant
Maclaine, of the Royal Horse Artillery, and he was
almost the last man to see him alive. The lieutenant
was captured immediately afterwards, kept a close
prisoner by Ayoub Khan, and eventually found lying
with his throat cut outside the Amir’s tent at
Candahar, after the Afghan leader’s flight.</p>

<p>A second journey for water becoming necessary,
Collis set off again for the village. He was returning
with a fresh supply when he beheld some ten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
twelve of the enemy’s cavalry approaching the gun.
The gun went off, and, throwing himself down in a
little nullah, Collis waited until it passed by. Then,
with a rifle which he had obtained from a 66th
private, he opened fire upon the Afghans, in order
to draw them from the gun and the wounded.</p>

<p>Not knowing how many were concealed in the
nullah, the Afghans halted and answered his fire.
They fortunately failed to hit the plucky gunner,
but from his vantage he scored heavily against them,
killing two men and a horse. From a distance of
three hundred yards, however, they came pretty close
to him, and he must have been discovered had not
General Nuttall arrived on the scene with some
native cavalry and made them turn tail.</p>

<p>“You’re a gallant young man,” said the General.
“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Gunner Collis, sir, of E. of B., R.H.A.,” answered
the gunner in business-like fashion, and the details
were promptly noted in the General’s pocket-book.</p>

<p>Then Collis hastened after his gun, which he caught
up with after a five hundred yards’ chase, and after
running the gauntlet of the enemy’s fire for several
miles farther, went safely in with it into Candahar.
He arrived there at seven in the evening, having
been marching for a whole night and day since the
battle.</p>

<p>There is yet another brave act to be recorded of
Gunner Collis, which contributed to gain him his
well-earned Cross for Valour. While the garrison
under General Primrose were besieged in Candahar,
anxiously awaiting the arrival of General Roberts’
relief column, various sorties were made upon the
enemy. On one of these occasions, in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of August, Collis was standing by his gun on the
rampart of the fort when Generals Primrose and
Nuttall passed in earnest conversation with Colonel
Burnet.</p>

<p>Hearing one of the former say that he wished he
could send a message to General Dewberry, who was
fighting away out in the village, the gunner stepped
up to Colonel Burnet and touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>“I think I can take the message, sir,” he said,
giving a salute.</p>

<p>The officers were doubtful about allowing him to go
on so dangerous an errand, but after a little
hesitation General Primrose wrote a note which Collis
slipped into his pocket. Then, a rope having been
brought, the gunner was lowered over the parapet
into the ditch, about forty feet below. He was fired
at by the enemy’s matchlock men as he slid down,
but luckily they were too far off to aim accurately.</p>

<p>Reaching the village safely, he delivered his message
to General Dewberry, and, dodging the enemy,
returned to clamber up the rope. While half way
up the Afghans tried to “pot” him again, and this
time a bullet came close enough to cut off the heel
of his left boot.</p>

<p>At the instance of General Nuttall and Colonel
Burnet, General Roberts recommended the brave
gunner for the V.C., and much to Collis’s surprise
it was presented to him on July 28th, 1881.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">ZULULAND.&mdash;THE DASH WITH THE COLOURS FROM
ISANDHLANA.</span></h2>

<p>At the same time that the war in Afghanistan was
being carried to a successful issue serious
trouble was brewing in South Africa. The Zulus
under Cetewayo, who had long been restless, now
threatened to overrun Natal and the Transvaal, and
precipitate a general revolt of the black races against
the white.</p>

<p>To go into the whole history of the quarrel would
take too long, but it may be said that the grievances
of the natives arose out of long-standing feuds
between them and the Boers over the seizure of land.
The immediate cause of the war was a dispute over
a strip of territory extending along the left bank
of the Tugela River into Zululand. To this piece
of land the Zulus obstinately asserted their right, and
their claim was upheld by a Commission which was
appointed to inquire into the matter.</p>

<p>After the annexation of the Transvaal by Great
Britain in 1877 Sir Bartle Frere had been sent
out to South Africa as High Commissioner, and
unfortunately for everyone concerned he now strongly
opposed the arbitrators’ award. Regarding Cetewayo
as a dangerous enemy, as a cruel, savage monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
whose power it was necessary to curb, he withheld
the award for several months, in the course of which
time the Zulu king nursed an ever-growing resentment
towards the British.</p>

<p>In this interval Cetewayo, who set himself to
follow in the steps of his uncle, the famous chief
Dingaan, perpetrated many atrocities which showed
him to be a bloodthirsty tyrant. When he was
remonstrated with for his cruelties he insolently
answered that the killing he had done was nothing
to the killing he intended to do, a reply which was
taken as a warning that the Zulus looked forward to
“washing their spears” in the blood of white men.</p>

<p>A raid into Natal to recapture some native women
who had fled thither for protection, and the subsequent
murder of the captives, increased Sir Bartle
Frere’s determination to take strong measures against
Cetewayo. Accordingly, when the award was announced
to the king it was accompanied with an
ultimatum that the vast Zulu army must be disbanded
and certain objectionable practices discontinued.</p>

<p>Cetewayo, looking over his impis, which numbered
some 50,000 warriors&mdash;all well drilled and well
armed&mdash;laughed at the proposal. His army had
measured itself against the white men already and
with no little success. So the thirty days of grace
allowed him passed unheeded, and, war having been
declared, a British force crossed the Tugela into
Zululand.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford, who commanded the troops,
divided his little army into three main columns.
One marched to an important station in the Transvaal;
another to a position near the mouth of the Tugela;
and the third&mdash;the invading force&mdash;to Rorke’s Drift,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
on the banks of the Buffalo River, thence to cross
over into Zululand. It was to this last column that
the great defeat at Isandhlana befell, a disaster
which filled all England with consternation when the
news of it arrived. And to it belongs the story of
how Lieutenants Melvill and Coghill made that
desperate dash to escape with the regimental colours
of the 24th that won them everlasting fame.</p>

<p class="tb">How the disaster occurred is soon told. Although
advised by Boer veterans well versed in Zulu warfare
as to the necessity of laagering his waggons every
evening and of throwing out scouts well in advance,
Lord Chelmsford preferred to adopt his own tactics.
He was an experienced and brave officer, whose
record of active service included the Crimean, Indian
Mutiny, and Abyssinian campaigns, but he now
made the fatal mistake of despising the enemy before
him.</p>

<p>After one or two successful skirmishes with the
Zulus, the little force of about 1300 men marched
up through the country, crossed the Buffalo River,
and encamped at the foot of a hill known to the
natives as Isandhlana, “the lion’s hill.” Here the
tents were pitched but no laager formed; no proper
precautions taken to guard against an attack.</p>

<p>This was negligence enough, but worse was to
follow. Two small reconnoitring parties who were
sent out on January 21st were alarmed by the sight
of a large body of Zulus not far away. In some
haste they sent to the camp for reinforcements. On
receipt of this intelligence Lord Chelmsford got
together several companies of the 24th, some mounted
infantry and a few guns, and at a very early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hour the next morning started out to meet, as
he confidently supposed, Cetewayo’s main army.
A body of Zulus was encountered and repulsed, but
they did not form the larger portion of Cetewayo’s
impis. While the British commander-in-chief was
thus decoyed from his base, an army of 20,000
Zulus was hastening fleet-footed round the hills, to
swoop down upon the doomed camp.</p>

<p>At Isandhlana only eight hundred men had been
left. These comprised a handful of Mounted Infantry
and Volunteers, seventy of the Royal Artillery with
two guns, and some companies of the 24th Regiment
and the Natal Carabineers. This puny force was
under the command of Colonel Durnford, R.E., who
had been hastily summoned thither from Rorke’s
Drift.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford marched out at about four in the
morning. Five hours later the advancing Zulu impis
were sighted by the watchers at Isandhlana, and an
urgent message was despatched to the front. This
message the General disregarded, his aide-de-camp’s
telescope having assured him that the camp was
unmolested.</p>

<p>Not everyone, however, shared this optimistic
opinion, for Colonel Harness and Major Black,
believing the messenger’s story to be true, started
back to Isandhlana on their own account, taking four
companies with them. But, to their grief, they were
peremptorily recalled. Had they continued their
journey they would have been in time to witness the
end of the death struggle which was even then in
progress at the camp; though it is doubtful if
they could have done anything to save their
comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight hundred against twenty thousand. What
chance had they?</p>

<p>By noon the crescent of the Zulu army had
enveloped the camp. Drawing closer and still closer
in, the ringed warriors, the cream of Cetewayo’s fighting
men, armed with assegai, knobkerry, and rifle, burst
upon Durnford’s little company as they hastily tried
to form a laager with the waggons. Durnford
himself was in the thick of it, encouraging the
troopers, placing a gun here and ordering a charge
there. But it was all in vain.</p>

<p>Before the fierce fire of thousands of Zulu rifles,
and before the host of assegais that hurtled through
the air, the redcoats and the Basutos of the Native
Contingent went down like corn under the sickle.
They fought well, as desperate men will when driven
to bay; but while they fired and reloaded and fired
again behind them came the right horn of the overlapping
Zulu army to strike at them in the rear.
<em>That</em>, and not a panic-stricken flight, accounted for
the many assegai wounds which were afterwards
observed in the fallen men’s backs.</p>

<p>There were numerous deeds of valour performed
that day, of which some account has come down to us
from the Zulus themselves. The 24th, the South
Wales Borderers, a regiment with a famous record,
knew how to die, and officers and men accounted for
many a dusky foe ere they themselves were borne
down.</p>

<p class="caption">WITH THE FLAG … FIRMLY GRIPPED IN HIS HAND, MELVILL
SPURRED HIS HORSE FOR THE RIVER.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_173">Page 173.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>We have a picture of little parties of them found
lying with their fifty or sixty rounds of spent
cartridges beside their dead bodies, to give colour to
the Zulus’ story that they “could not make way
against the soldiers until they ceased firing.” Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and then only, could the deadly assegais finish their
work, as the warriors leapt in with the fierce death-hiss.</p>

<p>And we have another picture given us of Captain
Younghusband, of the same regiment, standing erect
in an empty waggon with three privates, and keeping
a crowd of the enemy at bay. The others fall at
last, shot or assegaied by the Zulus who clamber up
the sides, but the tall, soldierly figure holds the warriors
off. Then, his last cartridge gone, he leaps down, sword
in hand, to cut his way through to liberty if it be
possible.</p>

<p>It was not possible. But he died fighting like a
lion. Said a Zulu who took part in the attack, “All
those who tried to stab him were knocked over at
once. He kept his ground for a long time, until
someone shot him.”</p>

<p>Very few escaped alive from that camp of death.
Of the gallant eight hundred all but six lay stretched
lifeless around the waggons and overturned tents, or
on the rough ground to the rear, where a line of
corpses marked the path to the river.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Teignmouth Melvill, Adjutant of the
1st Battalion of the 24th Regiment, was among
those who got away when all hope of rescue was given
up. To him Colonel Pulleine confided the Queen’s
colours, telling him to make the best of his way back
to safety. For himself, and those with him, said the
colonel, their duty was plain. There was no thought
of flight. “Men, we are here, and here we must
stop!” was his brief address to the remnant of the
1st Battalion; and stop they did, till they and their
brave colonel had fallen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the flag rolled and cased and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
firmly gripped in his hand, Melvill spurred his horse
through the press and dashed for the river. After
him panted a score or more of Zulus, pausing only
in their pursuit to stab any of the other fugitives
whom they passed.</p>

<p>For six miles the adjutant galloped on his ride for
life, gradually leaving the Zulus behind, though their
shots continued to follow him. He had now been
joined by Lieutenant Nevill Aylmer Coghill, of his
own regiment, who had cut his way through the circle
of Zulus. Then the tossing waters of the Buffalo
came in view, and how the fugitives’ hearts must have
risen at the sight. For on the other side of the river
lay Natal and safety.</p>

<p>A last desperate spurt and the bank was gained.
Down the steep slope scrambled horses and riders,
and plunged into the swirling stream. The Buffalo
runs swiftly between its high banks, the water being
broken up by large rocks, dotted here and there.
Exhausted after its flight, Melvill’s horse failed to
make headway against the swift current, and in its
struggles the adjutant was swept out of his saddle.</p>

<p>Not far away from him, on another rock, was an
officer of the Native Contingent, named Higginson.</p>

<p>“Catch hold of the pole!” cried the adjutant; and
the other, leaning over, made a grab at it as the colours
came within reach. But he, too, was carried away.</p>

<p>By this time the foremost of the Zulus had come
up, and they at once opened fire upon the helpless men
in the river. Lieutenant Coghill, meanwhile, had
swum his horse across the stream and gained the
opposite bank in safety. Reining up on the top of
the slope, he looked back and saw Melvill struggling
in the water below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a chance of life for him. His horse was
still fresh, and the road to Helpmakaar stretched
away behind him. But Coghill gave no thought to
himself, or if he did he banished it instantly from his
mind. Riding down the bank again, he plunged into
the river with a cheery call to Melvill to “hold on.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="335" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GRAVE OF MELVILL AND COGHILL.</p>
</div>

<p>Then, just as he reached the other two, his horse
was shot. The current carried it swiftly down the
stream, as a few moments later it bore the colours which
it had wrenched from Melvill’s grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The three were now still more at the Zulus’ mercy.
Bullets splashed the water round them, and several
of the warriors were scrambling down the bank towards
them. By making great efforts, however, Coghill being
hampered by an injured knee, they reached the Natal
side. Here, before they had gone far, the Zulus caught
them up, and the two lieutenants turned to make a
fight for it.</p>

<p>I need not dwell on the last sad scene. Higginson&mdash;and
we may think no shame of him for doing so&mdash;had
gone on alone. He had no revolver or weapon
of any kind with which to defend himself. Coghill
and Melvill had their revolvers.</p>

<p>Standing in front of an enormous rock, the two
officers faced their foes, to sell their lives as dearly as
possible. And when their bodies were discovered
days later the stiffened corpses of a dozen Zulus lying
almost in a circle round them bore eloquent witness
to the gallant stand for life that they had made.
They were buried side by side on the spot where
they had fallen, while a simple granite cross was raised
to mark their grave and tell to future generations the
story of how Lieutenants Melvill and Coghill died to
save the colours of their regiment.</p>

<p>The flag itself, it may be added, was found by
a search party some distance down the river. It was
brought back to England at the close of the war and
presented to her Majesty the Queen, who tenderly
placed upon it a wreath of immortelles in remembrance
of the gallant pair whose lives had been given
for it.</p>

<p>At about the same time an announcement appeared
in the <cite>London Gazette</cite> to the effect that had Melvill
and Coghill lived they would have received the V.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
And so their names, too, are added to the glorious roll
of honour.</p>

<p class="tb">On the same day that Merrill and Coghill won fame,
Samuel Wassall, a private of the 80th Regiment who
had been serving with the Mounted Infantry, earned
the third Cross that is associated with Isandhlana.
Having escaped from the Zulus, he too turned his
horse towards the Buffalo River. He was pursued, but
managed to outdistance his enemies, and gained the
river unharmed at a point farther east than the ford.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to enter the water Wassall saw
another soldier&mdash;Private Westwood&mdash;battling vainly
with the current and evidently on the point of being
drowned. To jump from his horse was the work of a
moment. Then, throwing himself into the stream, he
swam to the sinking man’s rescue, brought him out, got
himself and the exhausted Westwood on to the horse,
and plunged once more into the river.</p>

<p>Some Zulus had appeared on the rocks above him as
he was in the act of mounting, and their bullets came
perilously close, but neither he nor his burden was hit.
The horse needed no urging to get across the stream,
and ere long Wassall was out of reach of his discomfited
pursuers.</p>

<p>The Staffordshire private takes an honoured place
among the wearers of the Cross for Valour, for his
courage in turning to the rescue of his drowning
comrade stamps him a true hero.</p>

<span class="smaller">ZULULAND.&mdash;HOW THEY HELD THE POST AT
RORKE’S DRIFT.</span></h2>

<p>The story of Rorke’s Drift is the story of one of
the most heroic defences in our military annals.
At this small post on the Buffalo River one hundred
and thirty-nine men of the 24th (South Wales
Borderers) Regiment, Durnford’s Horse, and the Natal
Mounted Police, kept off a huge army of three
thousand Zulus all through the afternoon and night
following the disaster at Isandhlana.</p>

<p>Modern history, I believe, contains no parallel to
this brilliant feat of arms, which stands for all time
as an example of the splendid courage and devotion
of which Englishmen are capable when duty calls.</p>

<p class="tb">At three o’clock in the afternoon of that fateful
January 22nd an officer of the Royal Engineers was
down at the drift watching the working of some
pontoons. This was Lieutenant John Rouse Merriott
Chard, now on active service for the first time after
seven years spent at various dockyard stations. He
had reason enough to be thoughtful, as he paced slowly
along the bank, for the drift was a position of extreme
importance. At this spot, where the river was most
easily fordable, the Zulus might be expected to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
if they attempted the invasion of Natal. And to
stay them if they came was only a small garrison of
less than a hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>The post itself was about a quarter of a mile
distant, an old Swedish mission-station converted into
a commissariat depôt and hospital for the use of Lord
Chelmsford’s force. From where he stood Lieutenant
Chard could see the two low buildings of which it
consisted, with a small cluster of trees in front and
at one side, and behind the white tents where the
soldiers were. It looked a poor means of defence
indeed.</p>

<p>From the mission-station his thoughts wandered to
the little force which had crossed by that same ford
eleven days previously and disappeared into the Zulu
country. What had been happening behind those
distant hills? He was not to be left long in doubt.
Suddenly two horsemen appeared in sight on the
other side of the river, spurring furiously towards
the ford. As they dashed up, the pontoon was
pulled across and the two were ferried over to
the Natal bank.</p>

<p>The new-comers were Lieutenant Adendorff, of
Lonsdale’s corps, and a carabineer who had escaped
with him from the Zulus. The lieutenant was in his
shirt-sleeves and hatless, his only weapon being a
revolver strapped round his breast. As soon as he
reached Chard’s side he poured out his breathless tale
of horror, the tale of the Isandhlana massacre. He
himself had come straight from the camp of death to
tell the news of the disaster and to warn the little
garrison at the drift that a large body of Zulus was
advancing upon it.</p>

<p>Sending the carabineer on to Helpmakaar, twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
miles away, where Major Spalding, the commandant
of the post, had gone to fetch another company of the
24th Regiment, Chard proceeded with Adendorff to
the mission-station. Here he found his brother-officer,
Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, who commanded
the company of the 24th, then encamped
close by, already engaged in putting the mission-house,
or store-building as it may more properly be called,
and the hospital in a state of defence. Barricades
were being prepared, and loopholes made in the walls.
Bromhead had a few minutes before received a similar
message of alarm.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible the tents were struck, and
all who were able were set to work to build up a
wall of mealie-bags, about four feet high, from one
corner of the stone cattle-kraal to the wall of the
hospital building. This afforded a protection to the
front of the post. The waggons, which all the
morning had been unloading the stores they had
brought from Helpmakaar, were called into requisition
and made to form a barricade between the two
buildings.</p>

<p>Everything that was possible was done to render
the position safe against attack, but the proximity of
a high hill (the Oscarberg), and a large patch of
bushes which there was no time to cut down, gave an
enemy a decided advantage.</p>

<p>Having seen that his directions were being carried
out, Chard, who succeeded to the command in Major
Spalding’s absence, went back to the drift to bring up
the pontoon guard. To the honour of these brave
fellows, a sergeant and six men, it is said that they
offered to moor the boats in the stream and defend
the ford as long as they could; but the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would not permit such a sacrifice. So the party went
up the bank together to the station.</p>

<p>Half an hour had now elapsed. The next thing
to be done was to send out scouts to watch for the
Zulus, and some of Durnford’s Horse rode out on this
duty. Their officer dashed back hastily soon after
four to report that an impi was marching rapidly
towards the drift, and further that his men were
bolting along the road to Helpmakaar.</p>

<p>With the cowards went a detachment of the Natal
Native Contingent, their “gallant” officer, Captain
Stevenson, flying with them. This desertion so enraged
the others that they fired a round after them,
killing a European non-commissioned officer of the
Native Contingent. The garrison was now sadly
reduced, but there were no more desertions. Every
man at the post was prepared to stand by it to the
last.</p>

<p>The line of defence appearing to Chard to be too
extended for his few defenders, he constructed an
inner breastwork of&mdash;biscuit boxes! “We soon had
completed,” he says in his brief report, “a wall of
about two boxes high.” Behind this frail barrier
was to be fought as fierce a fight as history has ever
recorded.</p>

<p>At about twenty minutes past four the leading
files of the Zulus hove in sight, and the garrison of
Rorke’s Drift flew to their several stations. Some
went to the rampart of mealie-bags, others to the
windows of the store-building, and others to the
hospital where there had been forty-five men when
the alarm first came, but where only twenty-three
now remained. Among those told off to guard the
wounded were Privates Henry Hook, Robert Jones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
William Jones, and John Williams, of whom more
hereafter.</p>

<p>Following the few hundred Zulus who came leaping
and dancing round the base of the hill came a
host more, their ox-hide shields in different colours
marking the regiments to which they belonged. In
true Zulu fashion they tried to “rush” the place at
once, but a heavy volley drove them back. Then
they began to take up positions on the hillside,
where many rocky ledges and caves afforded them
vantage-points, while others dropped behind ant-hills
and bushes, or sought cover in the two little outhouses
of the hospital.</p>

<p>“From my loophole,” says Hook, “I saw the Zulus
approaching in thousands. They began to fire, yelling
as they did so, when they were five hundred or
six hundred yards off. More than half of them had
muskets or rifles. I began to fire when they were
six hundred yards distant. I managed to clip several
of them, for I had an excellent rifle, and was a
‘marksman.’”</p>

<p>Hook in his account recollects particularly one
Zulu whom he “clipped” at four hundred yards
while running from one ant-hill to another. The
warrior made a complete somersault and fell dead.
Another Zulu who sheltered himself behind an ant-hill
gave Hook some trouble, for the Gloucester man
had to sight his rifle three times ere he got his
enemy’s range. The Zulu never showed his head
round the heap again, and when Hook went round
to look at him after the fight was over he found
the warrior lying there with a bullet hole in his
skull.</p>

<p>The hospital was the first building to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
attack, but at the outer wall of defence a fierce hand-to-hand
struggle soon ensued. Lieutenants Chard and
Bromhead were fighting hard at the front, the latter
being conspicuous in many a bayonet charge at the
dark-skinned figures that climbed again and again
over the mealie-bags. Prominent, too, in repelling
the Zulus at this position was one Corporal
Schiess, a Swiss, who left the hospital to join in the
fight, and distinguished himself by creeping along a
wall to shoot a Zulu who was firing from the end.</p>

<p>At last it was recognised that the defenders could
not hope to hold this rampart long. They fell back
accordingly behind the inner defence of biscuit boxes,
after two hours of fighting.</p>

<p>We may leave them there for a little time while
we take note of what is happening at the hospital.
Here the gallant six defenders have been quickly
reduced to four, two of the number having been
killed out on the verandah. Four men to get the
patients safely out of the building which the Zulus
have rendered untenable by firing the thatch!</p>

<p>Hook and John Williams come to the front first
with William and Robert Jones (the last two not being
related, by the way). As the Zulus burst in the
outer doors the two Jones guard these entrances with
their bayonets, their cartridges being expended. It
is quick work; stabbing and thrusting until the
pile of corpses in the doorway itself helps to check
the rush. This gives time for Hook and Williams to
carry the patients from the first room to an inner
one.</p>

<p>There are four apartments to be gone through
before the sick men can be carried out to the shelter
of the barricade, for the inner rooms do not communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
directly with the outside. Holes have to
be made in the partitions, and the poor sufferers
passed through these in turn.</p>

<p>Driven back and back, Hook finds himself suddenly
in a room where there are several patients. Then a
wounded man comes in with a bullet hole in his arm
which has to be bound up. A minute later John
Williams appears&mdash;John Williams who has just seen
his brother Joseph hauled out and assegaied before
his eyes, and who is now a still more dangerous man
to deal with.</p>

<p>Williams breaks a hole in the partition with his
bayonet, and whilst he does this Hook takes his stand
at the door. A few moments later the rush comes.
There is a fierce hammering at the door, it gives way,
and the sturdy Gloucester private drops the first
man to enter. Shooting and lunging with his bayonet,
he soon accounts for four or five. Assegais fly past,
but only one touches him, inflicting a scalp wound.
One Zulu seizes his rifle and tries to drag it away,
but while they are tussling Hook slips in a cartridge,
pulls the trigger, and another body is added to the
heap at his feet.</p>

<p>Every now and then a Zulu makes a rush to get
through, for the narrow entrance admits one man
only at a time; but none pass the grim figure on
guard there. And when all the patients have been
got out save one who has a broken leg, Hook makes
a jump for the hole himself, and gets through, dragging
the last wounded man after him&mdash;“in doing which,”
he says, “I broke his leg again!”</p>

<p>From this last room a window opens out on to the
biscuit-box defences. The patients are quickly passed
out to willing hands below, the while Hook with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
reddened bayonet stands by the hole in the wall to
see that no Zulu follows. Then, still sticking to his
particular charge, he drags him out and takes up a
position behind the barricade to do some more useful
work there before the morning dawns. Of the
twenty-three wounded who were in the hospital
twenty have been saved. The remaining three are
believed to have wandered back, delirious from fever,
into the rooms that had been cleared.</p>

<p>Although Hook and Williams have escaped injury
of any serious nature, the gallant Welshman, Robert
Jones, has not been so fortunate. Three assegais have
struck him in the body. He and his namesake
William, as I have said, have been most busy in the
front of the building, and how many Zulus they have
put to their account is not known, but the number is
large judging from the heaps of dead warriors whose
bodies are found in the ruins of the building next
day.</p>

<p>In this last stage of the rescue of the wounded
William Allen and Frederick Hitch, fellow-soldiers of
the 24th Regiment (to which, by the way, the four
brave privates above-named belong), make good their
claim to glory. Taking up an exposed position on
some steps leading to a granary, these two men keep
the ground clear between the burning hospital and
the barricade, their accurate fire making it certain
death for a Zulu to venture near.</p>

<p>By their courageous stand, for which they pay
dearly, every one of the rescued twenty is brought
into safety. And even when incapacitated by their
wounds from taking part in the fighting, the two
brave fellows stand by all night to serve out ammunition
to their comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>At the rampart of biscuit boxes were several
vacant places ere the first beams of light showed in
the sky. Where Hook knelt three men had previously
been shot. But under the cool direction of Chard,
Bromhead, and Assistant-Commissary Dalton, another
of the garrison, the line of defenders kept up a deadly
fire against the Zulus which stayed the rushes time
and time again, and drove back the picked warriors of
Cetewayo’s army to the shelter of their rocks and ant-heaps.
Thirteen hours in all the fight lasted, until
the Zulus drew off, baffled, beaten.</p>

<p>Several times they had seemed to be retiring, but
after renewed war-dances and that stamping of the
earth peculiar to Zulu warriors, accompanied with
much shouting and waving of assegais, they came on
again with a fierce yell of “Usutu!” which is a far
more fearsome cry to hear in battle than the war-whoop
of the painted Sioux. At last, just after four
a.m., there was a long pause, and then the impis were
seen to sullenly roll back out of sight behind the
Oscarberg.</p>

<p>The grim, smoke-blackened defenders peered wonderingly
after them from behind the barricade, hardly
believing that the host was actually in retreat. But
such was the case. After some time, those who went
out to reconnoitre and look for the wounded saw no
signs of the enemy. The Zulus had gone, leaving
some 350 dead behind them. On our side the losses
were but fifteen, though two of the wounded died
afterwards.</p>

<p>With the fear of a renewed attack later on, the
weary soldiers laid their rifles aside, and at once began
to strengthen the defences where they had been
broken down. Lest the store-building itself should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
be threatened with fire, they set to work to remove
the thatch from its roof, and while engaged in doing
so the watchers announced that another large body of
Zulus were in sight some distance to the south-west.
Immediately the men flew to their stations, but the
alarm fortunately turned out to be a false one. The
enemy, after advancing a little way, swung round
and disappeared behind the hills. They had seen the
column under Lord Chelmsford marching towards the
drift, and had had their stomachful of fighting.</p>

<p>A little later the British force, which had seen the
flames of the burning hospital as far off as Isandhlana
and had marched from the fatal camp to relieve their
comrades at Rorke’s Drift, came round the Oscarberg,
to be greeted with wild cheers and waving of helmets.</p>

<p>“Men,” said the General, as he surveyed the group
before him and heard the story of their great stand,
“I thank you all for your gallant defence.”</p>

<p>It was not a moment for fine speeches. The hearts
of all present were too full to find utterance in words.
But every man knew what was in Lord Chelmsford’s
heart as he thanked them simply for himself and for
his country.</p>

<p>For that defence, gallant indeed, eleven Crosses
were awarded, to Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead,
to Assistant-Commissary Dalton, Corporals Allen and
Schiess, Privates Hook, Williams, Hitch, and W. and
R. Jones, and to Surgeon-Major Reynolds, whom I
have not mentioned in my account, but who showed
great devotion to the wounded under fire.</p>

<p>Private Henry Hook, one of the principal heroes of
the defence, was called up at once before Lord Chelmsford,
just as he was, in shirt sleeves and with his
braces hanging down behind, to receive the General’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
praise for his conduct. He was the only one of the
eleven to receive his V.C. at Rorke’s Drift, on the
very scene of his gallantry, Sir Garnet Wolseley
pinning the little bronze Cross on to Hook’s breast
with his own hands on the following 3rd of August.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago Hook was a familiar figure
to frequenters of the British Museum Reading Room,
where, on retiring from the service, he obtained an
appointment.</p>

<p>Of the rest, Lieutenant Bromhead died in 1891, and
Lieutenant (afterwards Colonel) Chard in 1897. I
find only the names of Brigadier-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel
J. H. Reynolds, and Privates J. Williams,
F. Hitch, and W. Jones, in the list of surviving recipients.
To those who have the opportunity I would
say, seek out these heroes while they are still in the
land of the living and hear from their lips, if they
can be led to speak, the full story of Rorke’s Drift,
which I feel I have told but baldly here.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOME OTHER ZULU AND SOME BASUTO CROSSES.</span></h2>

<p>The progress of the Zulu campaign was marked by
many ups and downs before reinforcements
arrived to strengthen Lord Chelmsford’s force and a
crushing defeat could be inflicted upon the enemy at
Cetewayo’s capital, Ulundi. But, though our troops
sometimes found themselves in a tight corner, the
disaster of Isandhlana was fortunately not repeated.
The lesson of that fatal blunder had been learned.</p>

<p>Of the columns besides that which Lord Chelmsford
himself led into Zululand, the one commanded by
Colonel Pearson had met with some success. This
officer had been despatched to a post near the mouth
of the Tugela, in the south-east corner of Zululand.
Marching into the country, he fought a decisive action
by the Inyezani River, and occupied Eshowe.</p>

<p>The remaining column under Colonel Evelyn Wood,
marching to a station on the Upper Blood River,
established its base on the Kambula Hill. From
this force a small garrison was provided for the
town of Luneberg, and it was in connection with
this post that another V.C. was pluckily won on
the 12th of March.</p>

<p>News coming of a convoy of supplies being on its
way to Luneberg, Captain Moriarty went out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
meet it with a detachment of the 80th (2nd Batt.
S. Staffordshire) Regiment. The convoy, or rather
the first part of it, was met by the Intombi River.
Here a laager was formed, and the escort was
divided into two sections, one on each side of the
river. Seventy-one men were on the left bank with
Captain Moriarty, while on the opposite bank were
thirty-five under Lieutenant Harward.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of March, while both
of the little camps were sleeping soundly in their
tents, a thick fog rolled up, and with it came a
Zulu impi. Soon after daybreak a sentry in Moriarty’s
camp gave the alarm. Orders were promptly
given for the soldiers to stand to their arms, but
ere this could be done the Zulus were upon them.
Nearly all the men on the left bank were massacred
as they came flying from their tents, their captain
being almost the first to fall.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river the soldiers had had
time to arm, and they quickly opened fire upon the
enemy. A number of the Zulus now swam across
the river, although it was much swollen by the
rains, and seeing this Lieutenant Harward did what
has always been characterised as a very cowardly
thing. He left his men to take care of themselves,
and galloped off to Luneberg. His defence at the
court-martial which was subsequently held upon
him was that he rode away for help, and on some
technicality he was acquitted. Lord Chelmsford,
however, plainly showed that he disagreed with the
Court’s decision.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while their officer took to his
heels, Sergeant Booth rallied the men and assumed
command. For three miles the sergeant fell back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
slowly with his little company, fighting the enemy
all the time and keeping them at a respectful
distance. And he brought the whole of the thirty-five
safe into Luneberg, not a single man of them
having been killed! For this conspicuous action
Booth was soon afterwards decorated with the Cross
for Valour.</p>

<p>At the storming of the Inhlobane Mountain near
Kambula, a fortnight after the above event, several
more V.C.’s were won in an exceptionally gallant
manner. Colonel Wood, as has been said, had his
camp on the Kambula Hill. Anticipating an attack
from the Zulus, who were on the Inhlobane, he
decided to strike first, and despatched a little force
under Colonel Redvers Buller with instructions to
surprise the enemy and dislodge them. The attack
was delivered on the night of the 27th and the
morning of the 28th of March.</p>

<p>Leading his men, who were mostly colonials of the
Frontier Light Horse, and loyal natives, Buller
climbed up the steep side of the mountain in the
mist, and with a brilliant rush drove the Zulus
from their little stone forts. The stronghold was
captured, but the flying warriors took refuge in
the numerous caves with which the place abounded,
and great difficulty was experienced in routing them
out of these.</p>

<p>One party, whose fire caused some havoc among
the troops, had found a particularly well-sheltered
position. It was clear that they would have to be
dislodged. Certain orders, it is said, were given for
this cave to be stormed, but, chafing at the delay
that occurred, Captain the Hon. Robert Campbell
of the Coldstreams, with Lieutenant Henry Lysons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and Private
Edmond Fowler, of the Perthshire Light Infantry,
dashed forward to undertake the difficult task.
Many fallen boulders and thick clumps of bushes
impeded their path, and, to add to the hazard of
the attempt, the approach to the cave led between
two walls of rock where the passage was so narrow
that they had to walk in single file.</p>

<p>Campbell took the post of honour at the head
of the dauntless three and was shot at the mouth
of the cave. Leaping over his lifeless body, the
Lieutenant and Fowler sprang into the gloomy cavern,
killing several Zulus with their first shots. A number
of subterranean passages opened out from the entrance,
and through these the majority of the cave’s occupants
escaped to a chasm below. Here they found themselves
exposed to the fire of the two marksmen above,
and in quick time retreated down the hill.</p>

<p>Their mission accomplished, Lysons and Fowler
returned to their comrades to be congratulated on
their success and recommended for the V.C., which
was in due course bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>While these clearing operations were being performed,
however, the Zulus had received large
reinforcements, and Colonel Buller saw that he was
in danger of being trapped on the mountain top. So
he ordered his force to return down the hillside to
rejoin the main body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;" id="illus9">

<p class="caption">THE COLONEL HAD TO RIDE BACK… AND, WHILE ASSEGAIS
AND SHOTS SPED PAST HIM, CARRY OFF THE DISMOUNTED
MAN UPON HIS HORSE.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_193">Page 193.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>But for their colonel’s exertions and noble disregard
of self, the retreat might soon have become
a rout. As the soldiers fell back, the Zulus swarmed
up and over the top of the mountain and threw themselves
desperately upon the handful of white men in
the endeavour to cut them off. Many deeds of valour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
were now performed, Buller himself saving no fewer
than six lives, among those he rescued being Captain
D’Arcy of the Frontier Light Horse, Lieutenant
Everitt, and a trooper of the same company. For
each of these three the brave colonel had to ride
back towards the advancing Zulus, and, while assegais
and shots sped past him, carry off the dismounted man
upon his horse.</p>

<p>Redvers Buller is “Sir Henry” now, a General and
a G.C.B. among other distinctions, but I think he is
prouder of none of his honours more than the bronze
Maltese Cross which he wears on his breast for his
bravery that day at Inhlobane Mountain. And seldom,
indeed, has the V.C. been better deserved.</p>

<p>At the same time Lieutenant E. S. Browne (a
South Wales Borderer) and Major William Leet, of
the Somersets, gained the decoration for acts of
heroism of a similar nature, Browne having two lives
placed to his credit.</p>

<p>The seventh of the Zulu Crosses which I have
space to note in this chapter was awarded to that
truly gallant soldier the late Lord William de la Poer
Beresford. Wherever there was fighting going on
Beresford of the 9th Lancers was bound to be in it.
Only eight months previously, during the Afghan
campaign, he had joined Sir Samuel Browne
(another V.C. hero) in the famous march through
the Khyber Pass, having obtained a month’s leave
from the Viceroy, on whose staff he served as aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>How he won his Cross in Zululand was characteristic
of Lord William’s impetuous courage. With a
scouting party he had ventured across the White
Umvolosi River to discover what the enemy’s movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
were in the neighbourhood of Ulundi. They made their
way safely for some distance through the long grass
when suddenly a number of Zulus, who had been
lying in ambush, sprang to their feet and poured a
deadly volley into the party.</p>

<p>Two of the troopers were killed instantly, but a
third man who fell (Sergeant Fitzmaurice) was seen
to raise himself up from the ground where he lay by
the side of his dead horse. Of the retreating scouts
Lord William Beresford was the nearest to the Zulus,
and without a moment’s hesitation he turned his horse
and galloped back to the fallen man.</p>

<p>The story goes&mdash;and there is no reason whatever
to disbelieve it&mdash;that Beresford flung himself from his
horse and bade Fitzmaurice mount. The sergeant
refused to do so, telling his would-be rescuer to save
himself. Then the plucky Irishman seized Fitzmaurice
by the shoulder and swore that he would punch the
other’s head if he didn’t do as he was told; whereupon
with some difficulty the sergeant was hoisted up into
the saddle, Beresford mounting after him.</p>

<p>During the altercation the Zulus had come within
a few yards of the couple, and Beresford’s horse only
just managed to get away in time. Even as it was,
it is possible that they would both have been assegaied
had not Sergeant O’Toole, another Irishman, ridden
out towards them and with his revolver checked the
Zulus’ rush.</p>

<p>When Lord William heard that the V.C. was to
be awarded him for that exploit he asked whether the
sergeant had been recommended for the distinction,
and on learning that this was not the case refused to
accept the honour unless it was also given to the
other. This made due impression at headquarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and soon after O’Toole’s name appeared in the
<cite>Gazette</cite> together with that of Beresford.</p>

<p>Lord William met with a sad end to his career.
As may be remembered, he died in 1900 from the
effects of an accident received in the hunting-field.</p>

<p class="tb">With the V.C.’s won in Zululand I may well couple
those which were gained in the brief Basuto rebellion
of 1879. The Basutos, an offshoot of the Bechuanas
and a very warlike race, believed themselves to be
threatened with a British invasion from Natal, and
took up arms. A punitive force from the colony had
therefore to restore them to order.</p>

<p>One or two encounters with the rebels taught the
latter a severe lesson, but retreating to the hills they
made a determined stand upon a mountain called after
their chief, Moirosi. This stronghold the Basutos
made almost impregnable by a long series of stockades
on the one side of the mountain that was accessible.
On the other three sides it was perfectly perpendicular.</p>

<p>After several vain attempts this stronghold was
successfully stormed, Moirosi himself being shot and
large numbers of Basutos captured. What a terrible
task the Colonials had in fighting their way up the
steep slope will be understood when I say that the
troops had to storm some twelve or fourteen of the
high stone walls, or stockades, which the Basutos had
erected, the walls being loopholed for rifles.</p>

<p>In the ascent Trooper P. Brown and Sergeant
Robert Scott, both of the Cape Mounted Rifles, did
deeds of daring which singled them out from their
comrades for distinction. The former left his cover
under a most heavy fire to carry his water bottle to
some wounded men who were crying piteously for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
water. He was wounded twice as he was in the act
of stooping over the sufferers, one of the enemy’s
bullets shattering his right arm and rendering
it permanently useless.</p>

<p>Sergeant Scott was a no less brave man, though his
exploit was of a different kind. At one barricade that
the troops reached the fire was so merciless that it
seemed impossible to advance against it. But the
sergeant thought of a way out of the difficulty. The
enemy must be dislodged from their position by fuse
shells. Volunteering for the dangerous work, he took
some shells and ran swiftly towards the barricade. As
has happened often before when one desperate man
takes his life thus in his hands and braves a hundred,
he escaped being hit. Then, crouching under the wall,
he tried to throw a shell over into the midst of the
Basutos.</p>

<p>The first attempt failed, but the second succeeded.
Taking a third shell, he flung this after the others,
but owing to some faulty adjustment of the fuse it
burst almost immediately after leaving his hands.
The explosion was terrible. One hand of the sergeant&mdash;his
right one&mdash;was completely shattered, and he
received a severe wound in his right leg. Fortunately
for his comrades, he had ordered his party to retire
under cover, a precaution which undoubtedly saved
many lives.</p>

<p>The sergeant’s daring feat enabled the troops to
drive the Basutos from the position without much
further difficulty, and when he recovered from his
wounds the V.C. was awarded him.</p>

<p>With Scott and Trooper Brown must be bracketed
a third V.C. hero of that attack on Moirosi’s Mountain&mdash;brave
Surgeon-Major Edmund Baron Hartley, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the same corps. His Cross was won for particular
gallantry in tending the wounded under fire, and in
going out in the open to bring in Corporal Jones, who,
poor fellow, was lying badly hit only a few yards from
the Basutos’ stockade. Surgeon Hartley worthily
upholds the traditions of that noble brotherhood we
have already seen doing their duty in the Crimea, in
India, and elsewhere. All honour to the brave Army
doctors!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUTH AFRICA.&mdash;AGAINST BOERS AND MATABELE.</span></h2>

<p>The first Boer War of 1881 reflected little credit
on the British arms, with its disastrous reverses
at Laing’s Nek and Majuba; but it added some names
to the roll of V.C. heroes which call for special
mention.</p>

<p>I do not propose to enter into the history of the
war here or discuss its justness. Briefly, it arose from
the refusal of the Boers to surrender the Transvaal as
a part of the projected South African Federation.
Far from being reconciled to British rule, the Boers
were united in wishing to maintain their independence,
and at the end of 1880 they resorted to arms,
proclaiming a Republic.</p>

<p>The command of the British force which was sent
into the field was given to General Sir George
Pomeroy Colley, a veteran of many wars. On
January 28th, 1881, a large force of Boers invaded
Natal, and were encountered at Laing’s Nek, a frontier
mountain pass some twenty-four miles from Newcastle,
with the result that General Colley was repulsed with
heavy loss.</p>

<p>Laing’s Nek, which takes its name from a deserted
farm on the heights above the upper stream of the
Buffalo, forms a most important position, a large tableland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
at the summit giving the command of the plains
below. It was to this particular point that the
British general advanced. But the Boers had taken
advantage of the mountain spurs and the low hills
which flanked the steep winding road leading to the
summit, and were able to concentrate a murderous fire
upon our troops. Every effort was made to continue
the advance, Major Brownlow leading a splendid
charge of the Mounted Squadron, in which he had his
horse shot under him, but it was in vain. Very
slowly, for the Boers pressed hard upon them, the
troops fell back.</p>

<p>Then it was that Lieutenant Alan Hill won his
V.C. for a gallant action. Out in the open ground,
knocked over by a Boer bullet, lay Lieutenant Baillie
of his own regiment (the 58th). Running to the
wounded man, Hill tried to lift him into his saddle,
but finding this too difficult a feat he carried him in
his arms along the narrow road, until another bullet
put Baillie out of his misery. A little later the
lieutenant turned to face the heavy fire of the
Boers again, and this time succeeded in bringing
back two wounded privates to safety, himself escaping
as if by a miracle.</p>

<p>Very cool and brave, too, was Private John Doogan
of the 1st Dragoon Guards. Servant to Major
Brownlow, he rode close to that officer in the charge
of the Mounted Squadron. When the major was
dismounted and almost surrounded by Boers, Doogan
rode up and jumped off his horse.</p>

<p>“Take my horse, sir,” he said, “and ride off while
there’s time.”</p>

<p>The major refused, and with still more determination
when Doogan was wounded as he stood urging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
his master to mount; but although the enemy were
close on them both men escaped capture. For that
act of devotion Private Doogan was decorated in
due course.</p>

<p>Just a month later occurred the fight on Majuba
Hill. Colley’s object in occupying this position was
to render the Boers’ occupation of Laing’s Nek
untenable, but he was again unsuccessful, losing his
own life in the attempt. The story of his night
march up the hill and the death-trap into which he
fell need not be retold. It is a disaster one does not
care to dwell upon.</p>

<p>Against the gloom, however, one or two isolated
acts of bravery shine out prominently. That gallant
soldier Hector Macdonald, then a sergeant in the
92nd Highlanders, won a commission through his
prowess there, and Lance-Corporal Farmer, of the
Hospital Corps, a V.C.</p>

<p>When Surgeon Arthur Landon stopped behind the
retreating soldiers to dress the wounds of the fallen
men around him, Corporal Farmer and another
man stood by his side to assist. To their shame, be
it said, the Boers fired upon the little group,
hitting the surgeon, the wounded man, and Farmer’s
comrade.</p>

<p>Thinking to stop the cowards, the corporal waved a
bandage in the air to show that he was engaged in an
act of mercy. But it had no effect. Their rifles
cracked again, and the bandage fell as Farmer’s right
wrist was struck.</p>

<p>“I’ve got another arm!” he shouted, stooping to
pick up the bandage with his left hand and raising it
on high. But the Boers shot at him yet once more
and with deadly effect, shattering the elbow joint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
his arm. After which the brave fellow gave up trying
to teach humanity to such savages.</p>

<p class="tb">There were other Crosses gained in that brief but
inglorious campaign against the Transvaal Boers&mdash;at
Elandsfontein and at Wesselstroom; but I must pass
on to tell of some acts of valour performed in another
South African war of rather later date. In 1896
a serious rebellion broke out among the Matabele,
who had been living peaceably under the rule of the
Chartered Company for three years, and but for the
prompt action of the Colonials in Rhodesia the consequences
might have been far more terrible than they were.</p>

<p>The causes of that rebellion are not hard to seek.
Generally speaking, it is said to have originated in the
stringent measures enforced against the cattle plague,
the rinderpest, which was sweeping through the
country; but there were other and deeper reasons
why the Matabele rose. Since their subjection in
1893, after Lo Bengula was defeated, the natives had
been compelled to perform a certain amount of labour&mdash;paid
labour&mdash;annually, and had had to pay a very
large fine in cattle. All this bore heavily upon them.
They chafed under the disgrace of being a conquered
people, they who had been a great warlike nation;
and only awaited a favourable opportunity to throw off
the yoke.</p>

<p>The opportunity came in 1896, after Dr. Jameson,
starting on his famous Raid, had withdrawn the police
force of Rhodesia, with most of the big guns and
munitions of war. Believing the white settlers to
be at their mercy now, the Matabele chiefs, who had
been maturing their plans, gave the signal to rise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
immediately the civilised world was horrified by a
series of terrible massacres, far exceeding any that had
taken place in the 1893 rebellion. Within the short
space of a week not a white person was left alive in
the outlying districts of Matabeleland. Men, women,
and children, whole families in some instances, were
wiped out.</p>

<p>Prompt action was necessary to deal with the rising.
As quickly as possible a strong laager was formed at
Bulawayo, the chief town, and a corps of mounted men
enlisted. The nucleus of this force was a little company
of twenty-three Rhodesians, got together by
Captain Grey and known throughout the war as
Grey’s Scouts. The rest of the body comprised
troopers from the Africander Corps and various
Rhodesia Horse Volunteers.</p>

<p>Fine fellows were these; hard as nails, and the
best riders and best shots in the colony. For three
months, until the arrival of imperial troops, they
harried the Matabele without mercy, holding their own
against tremendous odds. In this campaign the
fighting was very different from that experienced in
the former war. The natives had learned the futility
of attacking fortified places, and the engagements were
fought out in the bush.</p>

<p>Many a tale is told of gallant rescues of isolated
settlers who were in danger of being annihilated at
this time, and many an instance is recorded of splendid
devotion shown to each other by the Colonials. “Never
desert your comrade,” was the motto of the troopers,
and faithfully did they live up to it. Witness the
story of Trooper Henderson.</p>

<p>Hearing that a party of whites at Inyati, about
forty miles from Bulawayo, were in peril, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Pittendrigh rode out with a few men to the rescue,
but on their way they learned that their errand was
vain; the party had been massacred. A body of
Matabele having been encountered during the journey,
and news coming of a large impi being in front, the
little force halted at a store by the Impembisi River
near the Shiloh hills. Here they fortified themselves
against attack while two daring despatch riders
hastened back to Bulawayo for reinforcements.</p>

<p>The much-needed help came. Early the next
morning thirty men of the Bulawayo Field Force
galloped up. They had to report passing through a
number of Matabele at Queen’s Reef, in the vicinity,
and further that two members of their party were
missing, Troopers Celliers and Henderson. The mystery
of their disappearance was not cleared up until three
days later, when both men came into Bulawayo,
Celliers wounded, on horseback, and Henderson, much
travel-stained, on foot.</p>

<p>Celliers told the story of their adventures. In the
affray with the Matabele at Queen’s Reef his horse had
been shot in five places and he himself badly wounded
in the knee. Becoming separated from their comrades
in the darkness, the two men had hidden in the bush.
Then, Celliers’ horse having dropped dead and his
wound making it impossible for them to think of
following the others, Henderson placed his comrade
on his horse and set off with him for Bulawayo.</p>

<p>Their way led through a difficult piece of country
which was known to be overrun with Matabele, and
Henderson had to exercise the greatest caution in proceeding.
Long detours had to be made; now and then,
as natives were sighted, they had to conceal themselves
among the hills. But though some parties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Matabele warriors passed unpleasantly close, the two
men escaped discovery. For three whole days they
wandered thus, without food, save a few sour plums,
Celliers’ wound all the time causing him great agony;
and never was sight more welcome than when the
white buildings of Bulawayo greeted their eyes.</p>

<p>That plucky rescue brought a well-deserved
Victoria Cross to Trooper Herbert J. Henderson,
making him the eighth Colonial to receive the decoration.
Celliers, it is sad to record, died from the effects
of the amputation of his injured leg.</p>

<p>This affair of the Shiloh patrol occurred in March.
In April there was a brisk action fought on the
Umguza River by Bisset’s Patrol, among whom were
twenty of Grey’s Scouts. Mr. F. C. Selous, who
accompanied this force and had a narrow escape of
being killed by the Matabele, tells the story of how
Trooper Frank Baxter, of the Scouts, here won the
V.C., though he lost his life in doing so.</p>

<p>The enemy had been driven from their position
with considerable loss, and the troops were retiring
from the Umguza, when a party of Matabele warriors
who had been lying in ambush to the left of the line
of retreat suddenly opened a brisk fire upon them.
The foremost of the Scouts galloped past, while
Captain Grey and a few of those in the rear halted to
return the fire. Trooper Wise was the first to be hit,
a bullet striking him in the back as he was in the act
of mounting. His horse then stumbled, and breaking
away galloped back to town, leaving Wise on the
ground.</p>

<p>Seeing the other’s peril, Baxter immediately reined in
his horse, sprang down and lifted the wounded man
into the saddle. Captain Grey and Lieutenant Hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
now went to his assistance, and got Baxter along as
fast as they could; but the Matabele came leaping
through the bush and closed in upon them.</p>

<p>Firing at close range, they wounded the lieutenant
and almost did for Grey, the captain being half stunned
by a bullet. As Baxter, left unprotected for the
moment, ran on, another Scout, with the picturesque
name of “Texas” Long, went to his assistance, bidding
him hold on to the stirrup leather. In this fashion
Baxter was making good progress towards safety when
a bullet struck him in the side, and as he fell to the
ground the savages pounced out upon him with their
assegais. He was killed before Long or any other
could have saved him.</p>

<p>If to lay down one’s life for a friend is the test of
true heroism, then Trooper Frank Baxter has surely
won a high place in the roll of our honoured dead.</p>

<p>At this same fight on the Umguza other deeds of
valour were performed of which no official recognition
was taken, but they are enshrined in the memory of
the colonists. John Grootboom, a loyal Xosa Kafir
and a very famous character, did wonders; and
Lieutenant Fred Crewe saved the life of Lieutenant
Hook in a gallant manner.</p>

<p>Hook’s horse was shot and its rider thrown to the
ground, causing him to lose his rifle.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pick it up?” asked Crewe, as the
other came hobbling towards him.</p>

<p>“I can’t; I’m badly wounded,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Are you wounded, old chap?” said Crewe. “Then
take my horse, and I’ll try and get out of it on foot.”</p>

<p>And, having got the lieutenant up into the saddle,
Crewe slowly won his way back through the Matabele,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
keeping them off with his revolver, and being hit only
by a knobkerry which caught him in the back.</p>

<p>The third V.C. of the campaign was won by Captain
R. C. Nesbitt, during the fighting in Mashonaland.
A party of miners in the Mazoe Valley having been
attacked by the natives, a patrol rode to their relief
from Salisbury, but was unable to bring them away.
On the 19th of June Captain Nesbitt was out with a
patrol of thirteen men when he met a runner from
the leader of the refugees, with a note which stated
that they were in laager and urgently in need of help.
A relief force of a hundred men and a Maxim gun
was asked for. The captain read the message out to
his men and proposed that they should try and rescue
the party, to which the troopers readily agreed.
Sending the runner on to Salisbury, the patrol at
once turned their horses in the direction of the
Mazoe Valley, and fought their way through the
cordon of Mashonas to the laager. Then, with the
three women of the party in an armoured waggon,
they started on the return journey, and after some
desperate fighting brought them all safely in to
Salisbury, with a loss of only three men.</p>

<p>Of such sons as these, Henderson, Baxter, Crewe,
and Captain Nesbitt, Rhodesia is deservedly proud.
And we “who sit at home at ease” while these outposts
of Empire are being won for us, may well be
proud too, remembering that they are of our own
blood, Britons in that Greater Britain across the
seas.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN EGYPT AND THE SOUDAN.</span></h2>

<p>Arabi Pasha’s rebellion in Egypt in 1882, which
was quelled by the British army under Sir
Garnet (afterwards Lord) Wolseley, was notable
chiefly for the bombardment of Alexandria and the
battle of Tel-el-Kebir. At Alexandria, as has been
noted in a previous chapter, Gunner Israel Harding
won the Cross for picking up a live shell and immersing
it in water. At Tel-el-Kebir and at Kafrdour
the two other V.C.’s of the campaign were earned in
no less gallant style.</p>

<p>The Kafrdour hero was Private Frederick Corbett,
of the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. During the reconnaissance
upon this village the leader of his company,
Lieutenant Howard-Vyse, was mortally wounded, and
Corbett obtained leave to remain by the officer’s side
while the others went on. The Egyptians were
keeping up a pretty vigorous fire the while, but the
plucky private calmly sat down and bound up the
lieutenant’s wounds as best he could, afterwards
carrying him off the field.</p>

<p>Lieutenant W. M. M. Edwards’ exploit at Tel-el-Kebir,
where he captured a battery almost single-handed,
is worthy of being related at some length. It
was, perhaps, the most dashing thing done in the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
At this hard-fought battle four miles of earthworks
which the Egyptians had thrown up in front of their
position had to be carried at point of bayonet. To
the Highland Light Infantry and the Royal Irish
Fusiliers was given the post of honour, and as the
word of command rang out both regiments dashed
forward at the charge.</p>

<p>Determined not to let the “Faugh-a-Ballagh Boys”
be the first in, Lieutenant Edwards of the Highlanders
raced ahead with his storming party towards
the nearest redoubt. He reached the parapet well in
advance of the others, and pulled himself to the top.
Then, jumping down among the Egyptian gunners,
revolver in one hand and sword in the other, he shot
the first who attacked him, an officer, through the
head.</p>

<p>Another grappled with him, and this man, too,
he shot; but while engaged in this struggle a third
Egyptian ran up and knocked him down with a
rammer. Three Highlanders leapt into the battery
at this critical moment, and Edwards was soon upon
his feet to lead his men in a charge upon the guns.
His scabbard had been shot away in the fight, and
his claymore broken in two, so after emptying his
revolver the lieutenant took the sword of the artillery
officer he had killed and carried on the fight with
that. And in less time than it takes to tell the
battery was captured with its four Krupp guns, all
the Egyptian gunners being slain.</p>

<p>After which achievement Edwards sat down on
the parapet to bind up the scalp wound he had
received with a towel, in Indian “puggaree” fashion,
afterwards marching to Tel-el-Kebir station, two and
a half miles off, with this decoration on his head. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
few months later he wore another decoration, the
Victoria Cross having been bestowed upon him for
his gallantry.</p>

<p>Although it is not a V.C. exploit, I am tempted
to include a remarkable feat performed at Tel-el-Kebir
by Major Dalbiac, of the Royal Artillery, that
Dalbiac who fell at Senekal twenty years later.</p>

<p>During the battle the battery which he commanded
ran short of ammunition and no more was to be had.
In this dilemma the major resolved that at all events
his guns should not stand idle, so, with a touch of
humour characteristic of him, he ordered them to
be limbered up, and took them forward at a gallop.
One can imagine the surprise of the “Gyppies”
when the entire battery came racing up one side of
the earthworks and down the other into their midst,
putting them fairly to rout!</p>

<p>In 1883 broke out the Mahdi’s rebellion in the
Soudan, which was to give us endless trouble and to
cost the life of Gordon. After Hicks Pasha had
perished miserably at Shekan, and Colonel Valentine
Baker with his Egyptians had been routed at Tokar,
Gordon was sent out from England to conquer the
Soudan, and with him went Sir Gerald Graham, who
defeated Osman Digna, the Mahdi’s right-hand man, at
El Teb and Tamai.</p>

<p>In the first of these battles, fought on February 29th,
1884, two V.C.’s were earned; one by a quartermaster-sergeant
of the 19th Hussars, who saved
his colonel’s life; and the other by a naval captain
who is now the well-known Admiral Sir Arthur
Knyvet Wilson, K.C.B. The latter won his Cross for
conspicuous bravery, which his chief, the gallant Sir
William Hewett, V.C., knew well how to appreciate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The Naval Brigade contributed to form a huge
square which moved steadily down upon the massed
Arabs, to whom this was a novel form of fighting.
As the troops approached closer little parties of the
enemy dashed out to fling themselves bravely but
vainly upon the bayonets of the front ranks or be shot
down ere they could get so far. The principal Arab
attack was directed against the side on which the
sailors were with their Gardner guns and here Captain
Wilson found his opportunity to distinguish himself.</p>

<p>So impetuous was the Arabs’ rush at one time that
a slight gap was made in the square. Seeing this,
a fresh party dashed up to break through the opening,
but they had to reckon with Wilson. In a flash he
recognised the danger, and, springing out to meet the
enemy, he engaged them single-handed.</p>

<p>The first Arab he ran through with his sword, but
with such vigour that the blade broke off at the hilt.
Nothing daunted at being thus left weaponless, the
stalwart captain clenched his fists and, as the other
Arabs ran in upon him brandishing their spears, let
drive right and left at them in true British style.
One after another in quick succession the sons of the
desert were sent rolling over on the ground, and then,
some of the Yorks and Lancasters coming to his
assistance, the enemy were dispersed.</p>

<p>Wonderful as it may appear, Captain Wilson
received only a few slight wounds in this extraordinary
pugilistic encounter. In all probability the surprising
nature of his attack so disconcerted the Arabs that
they were at a loss to know how to act.</p>

<p>At Tamai, which was fought on the 13th of the
following month, there were likewise two V.C.’s
gained. The first of these fell to the 60th Rifles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
A private of the Royal Sussex having been badly
hit, Lieutenant Percival Marling of the Rifles took
him up on his horse, but the poor fellow fell off
almost immediately. Dismounting, the lieutenant
nobly gave up his horse for the purpose of carrying
the wounded man off the field, and although it was
a critical moment fought his way to safety on foot.</p>

<p>Private Thomas Edwards, the second hero of the
fight, was a “Black Watch” Highlander who was on
transport service with the Naval men, having in his
charge two mules loaded with ammunition. His
gun of the battery was under the command of Lieutenant
Almack, R.N., “one of the bravest officers on
the field that morning,” to use Edwards’ own words.</p>

<p>In a sudden rush of the enemy the gun&mdash;a Gatling&mdash;was
surrounded, and of the three standing by it
one, a sailor, was instantly speared. Two of the
“Fuzzy-Wuzzies” then made for Edwards, who put
his bayonet through both of them. The lieutenant,
however, was less lucky. Attacked by several
Soudanees, he succeeded in disposing of one with his
sword, but before he had time to recover another
nearly sliced his right arm off with a slashing cut.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Edwards shot the Soudanee dead.
There then ran up, he says in his own account of the
incident, three more Soudanees, who threw themselves
upon the helpless officer as he leant against the gun-carriage
and ran their spears through his body. Seeing
that Almack was killed and that he could do
nothing more, the brave Highlander, who, by the way,
received a wound on the back of his right hand, took
his two mules and retired, keeping up a fire upon
the enemy as he fell back.</p>

<p>Yet another V.C. hero of the Soudan was Gunner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Albert Smith, of the Royal Artillery, the scene of his
gallantry being Abu Klea.</p>

<p>The story of this fierce battle makes exciting reading.
Late in December of 1884, Sir Herbert Stewart
with a “flying column” of 1500 men was marching
across the Bayuda Desert to Metemmeh, on his way
to relieve Khartoum and Gordon. He had under him
a picked fighting force, including some of the Guards,
and they started out from Korti with high hopes of
a speedy march to their goal. They little dreamt
of what lay before them.</p>

<p>The water-bottles of the men were soon emptied,
and when it was necessary to refill them it was found
that the wily Mahdi had dried up the wells along
the line of route. Only after a toilsome journey of
eighty miles was water reached, though even then it
was hardly worth the name. Such as it was, however,
it was priceless to the Tommies, who were half mad
with thirst, and every available receptacle was filled
with water.</p>

<p>Another march of a hundred and twenty miles
brought the column in sight of the wells at Abu Klea,
and in sight, too, of a strong force of the enemy. All
through the weary night the men waited impatiently
by their arms until morning came to give them a
chance of getting at the wells. Then, in the form
of a hollow square, the column advanced, “like some
huge machine, slow, regular, and compact, despite the
hail of bullets pouring in from front, right, and left,
and ultimately from the rear.”</p>

<p>Altogether there were over ten thousand Arabs
opposed to the little force, hemming them in all
round. There was no avenue of retreat; the column
had to go forward and cut its way through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was that for the first time in history a
British square was broken. With the utmost fury
the Soudanees swept down upon a corner of the
phalanx and by sheer weight of numbers forced a
way inside. It was indeed a critical moment.
Colonel Fred Burnaby, of the Royal Horse Guards,
was among the first to be killed, though not before
he had slain several of his assailants; and as more
spearsmen poured in, the slaughter was terrible. But
in time the troops rallied. The square was re-formed,
and not one of those daring black-skinned foemen
who got inside escaped to boast of his valour.</p>

<p>It was in this desperate struggle of bayonet versus
spear and sword that Gunner Smith saw his officer,
Lieutenant Guthrie, prone on the ground and at the
mercy of the enemy. The gunner had only a handspike
for weapon, but with this he rushed forward, hurling
himself like a thunderbolt upon the Soudanees. He
was in the nick of time. One of the warriors was in
the very act of plunging his spear into Guthrie’s
breast when the handspike crashed upon his head and
stretched him lifeless.</p>

<p>Standing over the fallen lieutenant’s body, Smith
kept the enemy at bay, and he was still at his post
when the ranks had recovered from the shock of the
onset and filled up the gap in the square. Then he
was relieved of his charge, but unfortunately his
gallantry had not availed to save the lieutenant’s
life. Guthrie had been mortally wounded when
he fell.</p>

<p class="tb">Taking a leap of several years, I may fittingly tell
here of how some more recent V.C.’s of the Soudan
were won. At Omdurman, where on September 2nd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
1898, the Khalifa was finally routed, the 21st
Lancers covered themselves with glory through a
famous charge, and three of their number inscribed
their names on the Roll of Valour.</p>

<p>It was after the Khalifa’s futile attempt to storm
the zereba where the British troops lay strongly
entrenched that the Lancers’ opportunity to distinguish
themselves came. While the main body
of the army marched steadily forward in the direction
of Omdurman, the 21st, under Colonel R. H. Martin,
were sent to Jebel Surgham to see if any of the
enemy were in hiding there and to prevent any
attempt on their part to occupy that position.</p>

<p>Away down the bank of the Nile rode the four
squadrons, A, B, C, and D, meeting with scattered
parties of dervishes who fired fitfully at them. Just
south of Surgham, behind the hills, some seven
hundred or more Soudanese cavalry and infantry were
suddenly espied hiding in a khor, or hollow, and
Colonel Martin passed the word that these were to
be cleared out.</p>

<p>Forming in line, the Lancers galloped forward.
As they neared the khor a sharp musketry fire broke
out, which emptied a few saddles, and then to their
dismay they saw that instead of only a few hundred of
the enemy there were nearly three thousand Mahdists
concealed there. There was no time for hesitation.
Go forward they must. So, rising in his stirrups,
with sword on high, the colonel cried “Charge!” and,
closing in, the squadrons dashed into their foes.</p>

<p>They went down a drop of three or four feet,
plunging into the thick of the Mahdists. Cutting and
thrusting fiercely, they forged their way through, and
with pennons proudly flying at last gained the steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ascent beyond. Many men, however, were left behind,
and but for the devotion of some like Private Thomas
Byrne the number must have been still larger. Byrne
saw four dervishes pursuing Lieutenant Molyneux,
who was wounded and on foot, and although he was
himself crippled with a bullet in his right arm he
rode back to the rescue. He tried to use his sword,
but there was no strength in his arm; the weapon
dropped from his limp grasp, and he received a
spear wound in the chest. By this time Lieutenant
Molyneux was out of danger, so Byrne galloped off to
his troop, which he regained without further injury.
The brave Irish private got the Cross for his pluck,
and, as Mr. Winston Churchill comments in his
account of the deed,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Byrne’s wearing it will rather
enhance the value of the Order.</p>

<p>One of the officers to fall in the charge was
Lieutenant Robert Grenfell. To save him, or at least
recover his body, Captain P. A. Kenna and Lieutenant
de Montmorency, accompanied by Corporal Swarbrick,
dashed back into the midst of the enemy. They were
unsuccessful, De Montmorency’s horse bolting as they
tried to lift poor Grenfell on to it; but the attempt
was a courageous one, and both officers were gazetted
V.C. a little later, Corporal Swarbrick being awarded
the Distinguished Service Medal. Just before this
gallant action, I may mention, Captain Kenna had
distinguished himself by saving the life of Major
Crole Wyndham, whose horse had been shot under
him, an act which alone entitled him to the distinction.</p>

<span class="smaller">V.C. HEROES OF THE INDIAN FRONTIER.</span></h2>

<p>The closing years of the eighties and the opening
years of the nineties saw a good deal of fighting
at different places on our Indian frontier. Through
internal dissensions or the interference of some
foreign power, some of the turbulent hill tribes
were in a state of continual ferment, and order
had to be restored within their boundaries by force
of arms.</p>

<p>In 1888 there was trouble in Upper Burmah.
The Karen-ni, or Red Karens, who form a group of
semi-independent tribes down by the Siamese border,
took to dacoiting again in a bold manner. An expedition
was accordingly sent into their district, with
the result that the disturbances were quickly quelled.
This “little war” comes within the scope of this book
for a notable display of devotion on the part of an
Army doctor which gained him a V.C.</p>

<p>With the Indian troops that went into action
against the Karens near Lwekaw on New Year’s
Day, in 1889, was Surgeon (now Lieutenant-Colonel)
John Crimmin, of the Bombay Medical Service. He
soon had an opportunity for putting his skill to some
use, for several of the Bombay infantrymen were bowled
over by the dacoits. Regardless of his own danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the surgeon proceeded to kneel by the fallen men’s
sides and dress their wounds.</p>

<p>In the bamboo clumps very near to him the Karens
were being chased and cut down by the troops, but
now and then a red-turbaned, red-robed figure would
peep out of a patch and take a flying shot at the
doctor. Luckily for him and his patients, they were
poor marksmen.</p>

<p>Having joined the firing line again, Crimmin made
himself useful with his revolver. Not for long, however;
the Red Karens are savage fighters, and our
sepoys had to pay for their victory dearly. The
surgeon was very soon busy once more, bandaging
shot wounds and knife cuts.</p>

<p>A mounted sepoy had been told off to stand by
him, but he was slight protection. At one time the
surgeon was set upon by nearly a dozen of the enemy,
who leapt out of the bamboos upon his right with
wild yells. Dropping his lint and bandages, Crimmin
whipped out his sword, ran the first man through,
and was hard at work with another while the sepoy
dropped a third. This warm reception disheartened
the Karens, and with a parting shot or two they disappeared
as quickly as they came. Then the surgeon
coolly went on with his work, the wounded men
murmuring many a “God bless you, doctor sahib,” as
he bent over them.</p>

<p>The winter of 1891 is memorable for the brilliant
little Hunza-Nagar campaign, which was brought about
by Russian intrigues with the rulers of some petty
states on the northern frontier of Cashmere. In the
storming of the mountain strongholds in Hunza and
Nagar three V.C.’s were won, by Lieutenant Guy
Boisragon, Lieutenant John Manners Smith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Captain Fenton John Aylmer, while many more were earned.</p>

<p>The most striking event in Indian history of that
year, however, was the revolt in Manipur, where the
British Resident, Mr. Frank St. Clair Grimwood, and
other Europeans in the capital were brutally murdered.
In connection with this tragedy a young officer attached
to the 2nd Burmah Battalion of the Punjab
Infantry, Lieutenant Charles J. W. Grant, performed
a dashing deed which made him talked of far and
wide as “the hero of Manipur,” and added his name
to the list of those decorated “for Valour.”</p>

<p>The state of Manipur lies up among the hills
between India and Burma. It is semi-independent,
like many of its neighbours, the Maharajah being
subjected to the control of a British Resident. In
1890 a family quarrel in the Maharajah’s own
household led to his deposition, his brother the
Senaputty (commander-in-chief of the army) placing
another brother on the throne as Regent.</p>

<p>This turn of affairs was tacitly acquiesced in by
the Indian Government, who recognised that the
change was for the better, but on the late Maharajah,
Soor Chandra Singh, complaining to the authorities
of the bad treatment he had received (and deserved,
by the way), some notice of it had to be taken. So
Mr. Quinton, Chief Commissioner of Assam, was
despatched to Manipur with instructions to arrest
the head and front of the offending, the Senaputty.</p>

<p>This gentleman, however, firmly declined to comply
with the request that he should surrender himself.
An attempt was then made to seize him in the
palace, but without success, and diplomacy was again
resorted to. A meeting was arranged for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
discussion of the matter, and one evening Quinton,
Grimwood, and several of the British officers had an
interview with the Regent and the Senaputty. Not
one of them was ever seen again alive. On their
refusal to accept the terms proposed by the Manipuri
chiefs they were all massacred.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Clair Grimwood, who was one of those
who escaped from the besieged Residency immediately
after the tragedy, has given us a graphic account of
her experiences. She was ignorant of the real facts
when forced to flee by her companions, the first
news being that her husband had been taken prisoner
with the others. Only at the end of her journey
did she learn the awful truth.</p>

<p>Down in the cellar of the house Mrs. Grimwood,
like the brave lady she was, carefully tended
the wounded amid the crackle of musketry and the
crash of bursting shells. She was hit in the arm,
though fortunately not seriously, and only desisted
from her task when it became evident that they
must all leave the place. The rebels had set the
Residency on fire.</p>

<p>With the wounded and an escort of sepoys, Mrs.
Grimwood and the officers who had survived made
a dash for the road, reaching it in safety. “I had
not even a hat,” she remarks, “and only very thin
house-shoes on. One of these dropped off in the
river, where I got wet up to the shoulders. We
were fired at all the way. I lay down in a ditch
about twenty times that night while they were firing,
to try and escape bullets.”</p>

<p>After ten days’ marching through the jungle-covered
country, fording rivers and scrambling
through swamps, not to mention a sharp encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with their enemies, the little party reached British
territory. They had just two cartridges left by that
time; one of them being reserved, it is noted, to
save Mrs. Grimwood from falling alive into the hands
of the Manipuris!</p>

<p>One is tempted to dwell at greater length on the
story of that dramatic flight from the Residency,
but it is with Lieutenant Grant that we are mainly
concerned.</p>

<p>Grant was at Tammu, a Burma village station
some distance to the south, when word arrived of
the outbreak in Manipur. No details of the massacre
or the escape were known, but in the hope of being
able to effect a rescue the young officer obtained
permission to lead a small force up to Manipur.
He took with him eighty men in all, Punjabis and
Ghurkas, with three elephants as carriers.</p>

<p>Through the teak forests they marched steadily
though slowly towards their goal, having to constantly
beat off the Manipuris as they approached nearer.
At Palel a sharp engagement took place, in which
the gallant eighty dispersed a large number of the
enemy. From prisoners that were captured here
Grant learned for the first time of how Quinton
and Grimwood had been murdered.</p>

<p>Believing still that Mrs. Grimwood and several
others were besieged in the Residency, he pushed
on with all speed, and at last reached the town of
Thobal, about half-way between Tammu and the
capital. At this place the Manipuris, a thousand
or more strong, offered a stout resistance to his
progress, but a furious charge at the head of his
followers cleared the entrenchments by the river-side,
leaving them free to be occupied by him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>These trenches the lieutenant at once strengthened,
building up the walls with mud, rice-baskets, ration-sacks
and everything that would answer the purpose,
even using his own pillow-case as a sandbag.
Provisions were fortunately to be had with little
difficulty, for behind them, on the other side of the
river, were some paddy fields.</p>

<p>The siege of his fortified position soon began, and
the enemy’s guns threw shell after shell into the
trenches before the Ghurkas could drive them off.
A brief halt was made in the hostilities while Grant,
as he records, had a lively correspondence with the
Regent and the Senaputty anent certain prisoners
whom they threatened to murder unless he retired.
Negotiations fell through eventually, and the attack
was renewed.</p>

<p>In all the fighting Grant played a heroic part,
making sallies with a few of his Ghurkas, and
striking terror into the hearts of the Manipuris.
“Found myself in a bit of a hole,” he writes at one
place in his journal; “for thirty or forty were in
a corner behind a wall, six feet high, over which
they were firing at us.” This wall had to be cleared,
so Grant and seven men charged down on it headlong,
and had “the hottest three minutes on record.”</p>

<p>The Ghurkas had a very proper appreciation of
their leader’s bravery. “How could we be beaten
under Grant Sahib?” they asked, when questioned
about this and similar exploits. “He is a tiger in
fight!”</p>

<p>The struggle at Thobal lasted a week. At the
end of that time, just as Grant was noting with
dismay that ammunition was running very short, a
summons came to him from Burma to retire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>The little force, without any further interference
from the enemy, who had suffered pretty severely, left
their entrenchments one evening during a terrible
thunderstorm, and set off on their return journey.
An advance party of a hundred and eighty men met
them near Palel, at which place some hours later they
fought another brisk action with the Manipuris.</p>

<p>In all this fighting Grant had escaped unhurt, but
a few weeks afterwards, while again under fire at
Palel, he had a very narrow shave, a bullet passing
through the back of his neck. As he said himself,
his luck all through was marvellous: “Everything
turned up all right.”</p>

<p>At the same time, making full allowance for the
element of luck, there is much, very much, to be
placed to his credit on the score of pluck and skill.
The difficulties before him when he set out for
Manipur on his gallant attempt at rescue were
tremendous, and only his undaunted courage and
resourcefulness carried him successfully through.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant is now Major Grant, V.C.,
having been gazetted two months after his dashing
exploit; and it is pleasing to note that every one of
his men who survived the march were also decorated,
receiving the Indian Order of Merit for their devotion
and heroism.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW SURGEON-CAPTAIN WHITCHURCH WON FAME.</span></h2>

<p>There was some consternation in the quaint-looking,
five-towered fort at Chitral on the evening
of the 3rd of March 1895. Sher Afzul, the usurping
chief of the little mountainous state in the north-west
of India, was approaching with a large force, and
some two hundred of the 4th Cashmere Rifles had
gone out under Captain Townshend to try conclusions
with the rebels. After several hours’ brisk fighting
in the villages nestling at the foot of the hills, the
troops had withdrawn to the fort, but some men of
one section still remained to be accounted for.</p>

<p>Captain Baird, with about a dozen Ghurkhas, had
not returned. He was lying somewhere out in the
darkness, on the hillside, where the white-robed
Chitralis were still firing. And with him was
Surgeon-Captain Whitchurch, who had bravely
hastened to his assistance on hearing that the captain
was wounded.</p>

<p>“Where is Whitchurch? Where is Baird?”
Captain Gurdon and the other members of the little
garrison asked the question of each other anxiously
from time to time, hoping that the missing men had
found their way into the fort. The surgeon especially
was needed, for Captain Townshend’s reconnoitring
party had brought many wounded back with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
But the answer still came, with an ominous shake of
the head, “Not in yet.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, while the occupants of the fort
set about preparing for the expected siege, the few
stars that were beginning to peep out of the clouded
sky looked down upon a strange scene in a little
orchard nearly two miles away from the fort. There,
under the trees, a wounded officer was being bandaged
by the skilful hands of another who bent over him,
a dozen sepoys and four stretcher-bearers standing
patiently by.</p>

<p>The operation finished, the sufferer was lifted
tenderly into a dhoolie. Then two bearers raised it
from the ground, the escort ranged itself alongside,
and the little party started out for the road leading
to the fort.</p>

<p>“Feel any easier now, old chap?” asked the
surgeon, who was striding by the dhoolie.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, Whitchurch; much easier,” replied
Captain Baird, suppressing a groan as one of the
bearers stumbled over a stone.</p>

<p>Contrary to the general opinion expressed at the
fort, neither of the two missing men had been killed
or captured by the enemy. When Baird had fallen
with a bullet in his side, his men had carried him
quickly to the shelter of an orchard close at hand,
and here they had escaped notice. All around them,
however, lurked the Chitralis, on the look-out to cut
off any stragglers from the retreating force.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Whitchurch’s party had filed
down the hillside and reached the road, but a cry of
warning from the native officer in front pulled them
up short.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>“We’re cut off, sahib,” he exclaimed, as the surgeon
hastened to his side. “The enemy have got in front
of us!”</p>

<p>It was, alas! too true. Although he could see
nothing through the gloom, the shouts and occasional
shots that reached his ears told Whitchurch plainly
that the Chitralis were on the road ahead. What was
to be done?</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to him. “Isn’t there
a way round to the fort by the river, Bidrina Singh?”
he asked of the officer.</p>

<p>The other nodded affirmatively. There was a track
along the river bank, he said, but it would take them
a mile out of their way and across some very difficult
ground.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the surgeon briskly. “We’ve
got to get to the fort to-night. So pull your men
together, Bidrina Singh, and make for the river at
once.”</p>

<p>From his dhoolie Captain Baird called Whitchurch
over to him, and begged that he would consider his own
safety first. “I’m badly hit, old chap,” he said; “I
know I’m done for&mdash;&mdash;” But Whitchurch shut him
up quickly. While there was breath in his body
he meant to stick to his comrade; there was to be
no talk of running away. So, picking up the wounded
man again, the native bearers took their place in the
middle of the escort, the latter closed up, and on
they moved across the polo ground towards the river
on their left.</p>

<p>Thanks to the dense darkness, they made good
progress on their way for a quarter of an hour or so.
Then a scouting party of Sher Afzul’s followers
suddenly appeared in front, and with a joyful shout
gathered round them. At Whitchurch’s quick word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of command the sturdy little Ghurkas closed in and
fired a volley into the midst of their foes. There
were yells of pain which told that some of the shots
had taken effect, but the yells drew other Chitralis
who were prowling near, and the answering shots of
the enemy became more frequent.</p>

<p>Whitchurch’s revolver spoke more than once with
good effect, and his “Steady, men! Aim low,” rang out
encouragingly above the din. The Chitralis, thank
goodness, were firing somewhat at random, not knowing
the strength of those opposed to them; but one bullet
at last found its mark. A bearer dropped his end of
the stretcher with a cry, and tumbled over backwards,
dead. The jolt of the fall wrung a groan from poor
Baird, in spite of his iron nerve. Then another
stretcher-bearer stepped forward and lifted the
dhoolie, and on the little party pressed again.</p>

<p>Firing steadily in volleys, the gallant Ghurkas
gradually cleared the way before them. The Chitralis
had no wish to stand in the way of those deadly
levelled barrels, preferring to circle round their prey
and drop in a shot as opportunity offered. Two more
bearers were killed, together with two or three sepoys,
and the surgeon now took one end of the dhoolie
himself.</p>

<p>They had gone nearly half the distance when the
enemy rallied in stronger force and barred the track
ahead. Things were beginning to look serious. “Fix
bayonets!” Whitchurch called out, and there was a
rattle of steel in the sockets. “Charge!” And with
a cheer the Ghurkas dashed at the cluster of white-robed
figures, sending them scattering right and left,
while a few lay writhing on the ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>That charge taught the Chitralis to keep at a more
respectful distance, but a little later some daring spirits
ventured nearer, and the last of the bearers fell shot
through the body. Whitchurch put the dhoolie down
and lifted up the wounded man in his strong arms.
The Ghurkas were wanted, every man of them, to
protect Baird with their rifles; not one could be spared
for bearer-work.</p>

<p>Again, it is said, the captain implored Whitchurch
to leave him and make a run for it to the fort.
Perhaps he felt already that his wound was mortal.
But again the brave surgeon refused to hear a word.
With Baird in his embrace, he struggled gamely after
the sepoys.</p>

<p>Along the rough, rock-strewn path the party
stumbled, working their way ever nearer and nearer
to the fort. A low wall confronted them thrice, a wall
behind which the enemy were quick to post themselves.
But jumping over with the surgeon to lead them, the
nimble Ghurkas swept the way clear each time, and
Whitchurch, having returned to pick up Baird, half
carried and half dragged his weighty burden to the
more open ground.</p>

<p>At last, after another fifteen minutes’ struggle, a
dark mass of trees loomed up ahead. It was the
grove of cedars by the eastern wall of the fort. They
were within sight of safety now. Still the Chitralis
hovered round, however, and a chance shot hit Baird
as he hung limp in the surgeon’s arms.</p>

<p>“Make for the garden entrance!” cried Whitchurch;
and the Ghurkas turned to pass through the grove.
On their right, by the main gates, was a confused
sound of shouting and firing. The enemy had already
gathered in force there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p>As they neared the entrance in the garden and gave
a ringing cheer, the sentries saw them. In a minute
the gate was unbolted, and the little party scrambled
through, but not before Baird was yet a third time hit&mdash;on
this occasion in the face, as his head rested on
Whitchurch’s shoulder. How often has it happened
in similar rescues, that the wounded has been the
target for the enemy’s bullets, while the rescuer has
escaped scot free! It was the story of “Dhoolie
Square” repeated again, the story of McManus, Ryan,
and Captain Arnold.</p>

<p>Inside the fort enclosure the officers gathered quickly
round Whitchurch as the glad cry went up, “They’ve
brought Baird in!” And tenderly, very tenderly, for
he was suffering greatly from his hurts, the wounded
officer was carried to the hospital, where without any
loss of time the surgeon followed to save, if possible,
the life that was so dear to them all.</p>

<p>I should much like to add that he was successful;
but fate willed otherwise. Captain Baird lived only
a few hours, and the fort that he had helped to defend
so gallantly served as his grave.</p>

<p>Chitral was relieved about the middle of April,
when a British column succeeded in fighting its way
to the fort through the mountain passes. Three
months later the <cite>London Gazette</cite> contained the welcome
announcement that the Victoria Cross had been awarded
to Surgeon-Captain Harry Frederick Whitchurch, of
the Indian Medical Service.</p>

<p>Her Majesty Queen Victoria herself pinned the
Cross on the brave surgeon’s breast at Osborne, with
warm words of praise that were echoed by every one
who had heard the story of that plucky night-rescue
in far-off Chitral.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHEN THE AFRIDIS WERE UP.</span></h2>

<p>One hundred and forty miles south of Chitral, as
the crow flies, is the border city of Peshawar,
standing like a sentinel on the north-western frontier
of India. It is, indeed, the guardian of the gate,
for before it winds westward the famous Khyber Pass,
which links Afghanistan with our great Eastern
Empire.</p>

<p>Peshawar stands almost in the heart of the Afridi
country, surrounded with the hill tribes of Mohmunds,
Swats, Buners, Khels, Afridis and Orakzais. Fierce
warlike races are these, with whom from the beginning
of things we have had trouble. At one time we
thought we had tamed them, and we gave them the
rifles they had hitherto stolen, put them into khaki,
and made them wardens of the passes. But the wild
tribesmen cannot live without fighting; disputes over
boundaries arose, and these eventually culminated in
a rising that threatened to weaken our grip on these
frontier posts. Whence came the Malakand, Swat,
and Tirah campaigns of 1897-98.</p>

<p>When in 1897 Sir William Lockhart, Commander-in-Chief
in India, moved towards the rebellious tribes
with an army numbering 35,000 men, it was evident
that there was a powerful combination between the
Mohammedan clans in the hills north, west, and south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of Peshawar, against British rule. It was, in a sense,
a Holy War, with Mad Mullahs as instigators, though
behind them was the sinister influence of the Amir
of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The campaigns were comparatively brief, but they
must ever rank as among the most difficult in modern
history. The fighting was never in the open. Our
soldiers&mdash;Highlanders, Dorsets, and Ghurkas alike&mdash;had
to scale precipitous cliffs, worm their way up
tortuous hillside paths, and storm the stone “sangars”
behind which their enemies were strongly posted.</p>

<p>In the tangle of hills in which the engagements
took place the agile Afridis and their brother-clansmen
were perfectly at home. Rocks, caves, and
bushes afforded them ample shelter, and from the
heights that lined the passes they poured a deadly
fire upon the British troops. The work of dislodging
them, of driving them from their strongholds, taxed
the powers of our men to the utmost.</p>

<p>Of the several V.C.’s won in this arduous mountain
warfare the first fell to Lieutenant Edward Costello,
of the Indian Staff Corps, for a gallant rescue of a
native lance-havildar at Malakand. The wounded
havildar lay out in the open, exposed to the enemy’s
fire, when the lieutenant saw him, on a piece of
ground, too, that was overrun with swordsmen. But
the young officer with a couple of sepoys ran out to
his assistance, and brought him into the hospital.</p>

<p>A month later, in the Swat valley beyond the
Malakand Pass, three Crosses were earned for a very
brilliant action. At Landikai, on August 17th, 1897,
the advance guard of Sir Bindon Blood’s brigade
shelled the enemy from their position and drove them
out into the plain. Across this the Swatis retreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
at top speed, making for the shelter of the hills on
the other side.</p>

<p>In pursuit of the flying tribesmen went Colonel
Robert Bellew Adams, Captain Palmer, Lieutenant
Greaves, and Viscount Fincastle, the latter being
present in the capacity of <cite>Times</cite> correspondent.
Palmer’s horse was soon hit, its rider being saved by
some of his men who galloped after him. Greaves’
horse, becoming restive under the din of the firing,
suddenly bolted, and away went the lieutenant careering
among the enemy.</p>

<p>Seeing him alone among the Swatis, Colonel Adams
and Viscount Fincastle spurred hastily to his rescue,
but before they could reach him the hapless lieutenant
had been struck down by a swordsman. In the hope
that he was not killed they pushed on, and with a
furious charge swept the ground clear around his
body.</p>

<p>A well-aimed shot now brought down Fincastle’s
horse, leaving the young war-correspondent to meet
his enemies on foot. He at once endeavoured to
raise Greaves on to Adams’ saddle, but the wounded
man slipped off again, and a rush of Ghazis prevented
a second attempt for the time. Standing over
the lieutenant’s body, Fincastle bravely kept the
enemy at bay, being well aided by Colonel Adams.
Then two sowars rode up to them, and another attempt
was made to lift Greaves to the saddle. They
succeeded in their object, but another bullet hit the
poor fellow again as they raised him and killed him.</p>

<p>By this time Lieutenant MacLean of the same
squadron had led the rest of the troopers to the cover
of some trees. Leaving them here, he dashed out
with three sowars to the others’ help. Shots fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thickly among them from the Ghazis on the hillside,
but together they managed to get Greaves’ body on
to a trooper’s horse, and at once made off for shelter.
Fincastle and MacLean were on foot, the latter’s
horse having also been shot; and as they went along
the young lieutenant was hit in both thighs and
mortally wounded. Colonel Adams escaped with a
sword-cut in his right hand.</p>

<p>Both Adams and Fincastle received the V.C. for
their brave attempt to rescue Greaves, while Lieutenant
Hector Lachlan Stewart MacLean was gazetted at the
same time as one who would have been awarded the
decoration had he lived.</p>

<p class="tb">There was a sharp piece of fighting in the
Mamund Valley some weeks later, where two young
Engineer officers, Lieutenants Watson and Colvin,
distinguished themselves in driving the enemy from
the burning village of Bilot, and added V.C. to their
names. But I must pass on to tell of the famous
storming of the heights of Dargai and of how the
“gay Gordons” there covered themselves with fresh
glory.</p>

<p>In the advance of the British troops from Shinwari
towards Karappa a large portion of the division
under Major-General Yeatman-Biggs was ordered to
take the route through the Chagru Kotal. As
soon as this movement was commenced, however, the
Afridis posted themselves in great force in the
Samana Hills along the Khanki Valley, giving them
the command of the track along which the army must
necessarily pass.</p>

<p>The working parties on the Chagru Kotal were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
harassed by the Afridi sharpshooters that it became
important that the Dargai and other hills in the
vicinity should be cleared. On October 18th, Sir
Power Palmer, who was entrusted with the conduct
of the operations in place of General Yeatman-Biggs,
who had fallen ill, made a sweeping attack on the
Dargai position. The 3rd Ghurkas, led by Lieutenant
Beynon with a revolver in one hand and an alpenstock
in the other, led the dash up the cliff-side, and
successfully dislodged the enemy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for several reasons, the heights could
not be held. The water-supply was difficult of access,
and to have placed a detachment alone on Dargai
while the Afridis were masters of the Khanki Valley
would have been to risk a serious disaster. Under
orders from the Commander-in-Chief, the troops therefore
retired from the position.</p>

<p>As soon as this retreat was accomplished, the enemy,
who had been greatly reinforced, reoccupied the
heights and set about constructing stone “sangars,”
in anticipation of another assault. This followed two
days later, after fresh preparations had been made.
General Yeatman-Biggs had proposed another route
avoiding the Chagru defile, but Sir William Lockhart
determined to adhere to his original plan, viz. to force
the passage of the Chagru Kotal.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, October 20th, in the early
morning, the troops, strengthened by the addition of
two battalions and a battery from the first division,
left the Shinwari camp. The honour of carrying the
Dargai heights, which had to be stormed immediately
the Chagru Kotal was reached, was given to the 1st
Battalion of the 2nd Ghurkas, with the Dorset and
Derbyshire Regiments in the second and third lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
respectively. Behind these came the 1st Battalion of
the Gordon Highlanders (the old 75th).</p>

<p>To understand properly the difficult nature of the
task set them, something must be said about Dargai
itself. I cannot do better than quote the description
given by Captain Shadwell in his excellent book on
the campaign.</p>

<p>“The village of Dargai lies on the northern side of
a small plateau. The eastern edge of this tableland
breaks off, at first, in an almost abrupt cliff; but some
distance lower down the ground, though very steep,
shelves away less precipitously. This slope is thrown
out from the bottom of the cliff in the form of a
narrow and razor-like spur, with the path or track
lying along its northern side, well within view and
range of the cliff-head. But by climbing along the
southern side of this spur, troops can move from
Chagru Kotal, or certainly from Mama Khan, a
village half-way between the former place and the
plateau, unseen by the enemy.</p>

<p>“Connecting the crest of the spur, however, and
the foot of the cliff, there is a narrow neck or saddle
one hundred yards long by thirty broad, whose sides
are far too precipitous to allow of any movement along
them. Though devoid of all cover and completely
exposed to the heights above, this ridge had to be
crossed, so as to reach the path ascending to the
summit; and here it was that the casualties in the
attack by Brigadier-General Westmacott’s Brigade
(on the 18th) and the heavier losses of the 20th
occurred.”</p>

<p>This, then, was the dangerous passage to be “rushed”
by our troops. In addition to its exposure to the
enemy’s fire, it may be added that the ground was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
thickly strewn with rocks and boulders which greatly
impeded progress.</p>

<p>As on the first assault, the post of honour was
allotted to those game little fighters, the Ghurkas.
The 1st Battalion of the 2nd Ghurkas, with a party
of specially trained scouts from the 3rd, under
Lieutenant Tillard, swarmed up the slope at the word
of command and dashed headlong across the zone of
fire. In the rush through the pitiless rain of bullets
that at once descended two officers fell, one shot dead
and the other mortally wounded, while thirty men bit
the dust, never to rise again; but the rest reached
cover on the opposite side.</p>

<p>After the brave Ghurkas, the Dorsets and the
Derbys tried time and time again to follow, only to
be mowed down in heaps. All that succeeded in
crossing the ridge were a few who made a dash for it
singly or in small parties. How deadly was the
marksmanship of the Afridis is shown by the fact
that when Lieutenant Hewett, of the Dorsetshire
Regiment, led a section forward, he was <em>the only one</em> to
reach the crouching Ghurkas. Every one of the men
following him was killed.</p>

<p>It was in a pause at this juncture that Private
Vickery, of the same regiment, made himself conspicuous
by running out repeatedly and at last
succeeding in dragging back to shelter a wounded
comrade who was lying out in the open; this and
several other acts of bravery gaining him a V.C. in
due course.</p>

<p>For a time it seemed a sheer impossibility that the
position could be carried, though the artillery
was playing upon the enemy’s sangars continually. Noon
came, and still the three companies of Ghurkas were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
waiting under the cover of the rocks until their
comrades should join them for the final dash up the
heights.</p>

<p>At last General Yeatman-Biggs ordered that the
position must be taken at all costs. Brigadier-General
Kempster, in command of the brigade, now brought
forward the 1st Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders
and the 3rd Sikhs, and told them they were to make
the assault. Far up on the hillside the jubilant
Afridis were shouting defiance, amid the waving of
standards and beating of drums, confident that their
stronghold was impregnable. They rejoiced too soon.</p>

<p>Drawing up his men, Colonel Mathias, of the
Gordons, said: “Highlanders! the General says the
position must be taken at all costs. The Gordons
will take it!”</p>

<p>With their Colonel, Major Forbes Macbean, and
Lieutenant Gordon at their head, and their pipers,
Findlater and Milne, playing the familiar “Cock o’
the North,” the Gordons dashed over the fiery zone,
with the Derbys, the Dorsets, and the Sikhs pressing
close behind them.</p>

<p>Almost the first to be hit were Major Macbean,
who cheered on his men as he lay on the ground,
and the two pipers. Milne was shot through the
lung and fell senseless, but Piper “Jock” Findlater, who
was shot in both ankles, propped himself up against
a boulder and continued to play his pipes with
unabated energy. And to the inspiriting strains of
the old regimental air, the Highlanders and the others
got across.</p>

<p class="caption">PIPER FINDLATER … PROPPED HIMSELF UP AGAINST A BOULDER
AND CONTINUED TO PLAY HIS PIPES.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_236">Page 236.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>It was perhaps owing to the suddenness of the
rush after the long wait, and to the renewed artillery
fire, that the Gordons accomplished the task with
fewer losses than had attended the previous attempts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
yet for all that the casualties were heavy. In the
charge up the steep slope, where some of the Afridis
were already turning tail, more men were to fall ere
the heights were won; but won they were, the enemy
being sent flying in all directions.</p>

<p>It was a grand dash, worthy of the splendid
reputation of the Gordons, and well did they deserve
the burst of cheers with which the other regiments
spontaneously greeted them as they returned. Sir
William Lockhart, too, at a parade two days afterwards,
had a word or two to say about that exploit
which filled the Highlanders with pride.</p>

<p>For his gallantry in continuing to play his pipes
while wounded “Jock” Findlater in time was awarded
the Victoria Cross. There were many who considered
that Piper Milne also merited the honour, but the
authorities thought differently, and his claim was
passed over.</p>

<p>Two other Crosses on the same day were gained by
Private Lawson, of the Gordons, for rescuing Lieutenant
Dingwall and a fellow-private under a most
severe fire; and by Lieutenant H. S. Pennell, of the
Derbyshires, for a brave endeavour to save Captain
Smith of the same regiment. Only after a second
attempt, when he discovered that the wounded officer
was dead, did Lieutenant Pennell desist from his
efforts.</p>

<p>What other gallant deeds were performed equally
deserving of reward it is impossible to say. In the
fierce swirl of the fight many must have passed
unnoticed, and many heroes must have fallen at the
moment of their self-sacrifice. But we do know that
it was not only British officers and men who distinguished
themselves in that memorable fight. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the record speaks of one Kirpa Ram Thapa, a native
officer of the 2nd Ghurkas, who though badly wounded
in two places refused to fall out, and insisted on
leading his company to the very end.</p>

<p>One other story that I may note has a humorous
touch about it, and is characteristic of the good terms
on which officers and men are in the Highland
regiments. As the Gordons streamed up the ascent
to the summit of Dargai, after their bold dash, Colonel
Mathias, who was not quite the man he was in his
younger days, showed signs of being winded.</p>

<p>“Stiff climb, eh, Mackie?” he said, turning to his
colour-sergeant, who was by him; “I’m&mdash;not&mdash;so
young&mdash;as I&mdash;was, you know.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, sir!” the sergeant is said to have
answered, slapping his colonel encouragingly on the
back and nearly knocking the remaining breath out
of him. “<em>Ye’re gaun verra strong for an auld man!</em>”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUTH AFRICA.&mdash;THE V.C.’S OF THE SECOND
BOER WAR.</span></h2>

<p>The late war in South Africa, when&mdash;for the last
time, it is to be hoped&mdash;Briton and Boer strove
for supremacy, is too recent to need even an outline
of its history being given here. It was a war of
many blunders and disasters, and its record does not
make altogether pleasant reading; yet against the
gloom of it there is not a little to be set of which we
may be proud. After the war had entered upon its
second phase good generalship asserted itself; victory
followed victory in swift succession, and there was no
more looking back.</p>

<p>Many reputations were lost, while others were
gained, in this difficult campaign, but there was one
person whose prestige from the first suffered no loss.
That was the British soldier. In the face of a foe
remarkable for “slimness” and marksmanship, Tommy
Atkins once more showed himself the splendid fighter
that he always has been. We have only to remember
the fierce battles on the Tugela River, at Colenso, at
Magersfontein, at Paardeberg, and elsewhere, to assure
ourselves on this point. Under the most terrible
fusillade&mdash;and how terrible it was at times can hardly
be conveyed in words&mdash;our gunners and our infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
never hesitated or winced. Throughout the ranks
they fought with an indomitable courage that compelled
the admiration of the Boers, and in the pride
we feel at their bravery and devotion we are glad to
forget the incompetency displayed by many of their
leaders.</p>

<p>Of the acts of individual heroism that were performed
pages and pages might be written without
exhausting the subject. In the leading of forlorn
hopes, and in the succouring of wounded comrades
under fire, officers and privates alike were ever ready
to risk their lives; and the fact that no fewer than
seventy-eight Victoria Crosses were won in the war
speaks for itself. How some of these rewards for
valour were gained it is my purpose to relate in the
present chapter.</p>

<p>Among the first to be decorated was an Army
surgeon, a worthy successor to Jee, Home, and those
others of whom mention has been made. At the
battle of Colenso, in December 1899, Major William
Babtie, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, received
word that a number of wounded artillerymen were
in need of assistance. They lay in a donga, or hollow,
close by the guns of their batteries (the 14th and
15th), sheltered from the Boer marksmen, but suffering
considerable agony from their wounds.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, and quite alone, Major Babtie
rode out to them. He knew full well that the
instant he appeared in the open he would become a
target for the enemy’s rifles, and few of those who
watched him go on his errand of mercy expected to
see him alive again. But although his horse was
struck three times, he himself by good fortune escaped
being hit. Reaching the donga, he found a score of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
poor fellows badly needing attention, and with
wonderful coolness he set about dressing their injuries.
The Boers, who had no scruples about firing upon the
wounded, made repeated attempts to get within range
of the intrepid surgeon and his patients, but with ill-success.
Babtie seemed to bear a charmed life, and
he was able to save many a gunner who but for his
prompt help must have died on the field.</p>

<p>The Royal Army Medical Corps, it may be mentioned,
won three more Crosses in South Africa, making the
total placed to their credit seven. Lieutenants
Douglas, Nickerson, and Inkson were the other heroes,
the last-named being conspicuous for carrying a
wounded comrade for over three hundred yards under
heavy fire to a place of safety.</p>

<p>It was at Colenso that the magnificent attempt to
save the guns was made which resulted in the sad
death of Lieutenant the Hon. F. H. S. Roberts, the
only son of Lord Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief.
Colonel Long, with the 14th and 66th Batteries of the
Royal Field Artillery, had pressed forward to drive
the Boers from their trenches along the bank of the
Tugela, expecting to be supported by reinforcements.
But under the deadly fire directed upon him he was
obliged to retire, leaving many dead and wounded
behind him, and leaving, too, twelve guns standing
ready for use, with their breech-blocks still in them.</p>

<p>For a long time the guns stood deserted thus,
while the battle raged to right and left of them.
Then, as General Hildyard’s infantry, including the
Devons, the Queen’s, and the Scots Fusiliers, made
their dashing advance upon the Boer positions, a trio
of staff officers who were with Generals Buller and
Clery volunteered to save the guns if possible. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
three were Captains Schofield and Congreve, and
Lieutenant Roberts.</p>

<p>Other volunteers were soon forthcoming when it
was known that the attempt was to be made, and
corporals, linesmen, and some drivers of ammunition
waggons, with two or three spare teams, galloped out
after their leaders. The guns were reached, but at
once Boer shells and bullets began to drop thickly
around. Captain Congreve was almost the first to
be hit, being wounded in the leg. Then young
Roberts was struck, at the same time that a shell
burst under his horse, inflicting severe wounds upon
him. “He was looking over his shoulder at Schofield,”
says an eye-witness, “laughing and working his stick
with a circular motion, like a jockey, to encourage his
horse,” when his first bullet found him, and he fell
mortally wounded. In the meantime the gallant
gunners and drivers were limbering up with all speed,
and thanks to Captain Schofield’s exertions, two of the
guns were hauled back in safety.</p>

<p>Later on, Captain Reed of the 7th Battery, Royal
Field Artillery, made another and partially successful
effort to rescue some of the remaining ten guns,
receiving a bad wound in his thigh in the attempt;
but almost all of them had to be abandoned. For
their gallantry, however, Captains Schofield, Congreve,
and Reed, with Lieutenant Roberts, were all recommended
for the V.C., the three first-named alone
surviving to receive the decoration. Poor Lieutenant
Roberts, as will be remembered, died at Chievely, two
days later.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE GUNS WERE REACHED, BUT AT ONCE BOER SHELLS AND BULLETS
BEGAN TO DROP THICKLY AROUND.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_242">Page 242.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>As to the bravery of the men who helped them to
save the guns, both Captain Schofield and Captain
Reed have borne eloquent tribute. “Bosh!” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Reed, when he was complimented on his exploit; “it
was all the drivers.” And if you ask Captain
Schofield, you will find he will make much the same
answer. While the rain of bullets poured on them
the drivers limbered up in a calm, business-like fashion,
as if there wasn’t a Boer within a dozen miles of
them.</p>

<p>“Just to show you what cool chaps those drivers
were,” says Captain Schofield, “when I was hooking
on one of the guns, one of them said, ‘Elevate the
muzzle a little more, sir.’ That’s a precaution for
galloping in rough country, but I shouldn’t have
thought of it&mdash;not just then, at any rate. Pretty
cool, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>They were gallant men those drivers without
doubt, as gallant as Colonel Long’s gunners, who fell
one by one by their guns until only two were left,
two who continued the unequal battle alone, and when
the ordinary ammunition was exhausted fired their
last shot, the emergency rounds of case; after which
they stood at attention and waited for the end that
came swiftly. All could not be decorated, however,
though all deserved equal honour, and so Corporal
G. E. Nurse, of the Royal Field Artillery, was elected
to receive the V.C. as the most fitting representative.</p>

<p>The next heroes on the list are two brave men of
the Protectorate Regiment, Sergeant H. R. Martineau
and Trooper (now Lieutenant) H. E. Ramsden.
During a sortie from besieged Mafeking Sergeant
Martineau’s attention was called to Corporal Le
Camp, who had been struck down by a Boer bullet.
The latter was lying in the open less than a dozen
yards from the enemy’s trenches and bleeding
profusely from his wound. Not far away were some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
bushes which offered ample shelter, so making a dash
for the corporal, the sergeant carried and dragged him
thither as best he could. Then, kneeling by the
wounded man’s side, he carefully bandaged the gaping
shot-hole and stanched the flow of blood.</p>

<p>Despite the shelter of the bushes, Martineau did
not escape being hit. He was shot in the side as he
stooped over the corporal, and he was struck yet
twice more when, at the order to retire, he picked up
Le Camp and carried him after his comrades, who
were falling back upon the town. That plucky rescue
cost the sergeant an arm, but it won him&mdash;though
small compensation, perhaps&mdash;a V.C.</p>

<p>The same honour fell to Trooper H. E. Ramsden in
this fight, for carrying his brother out of danger in
very similar circumstances. The list of those who
figured in gallant actions of this kind, indeed, is
a long one. There was Second-Lieutenant John
Norwood (now a captain), of the 5th Dragoon Guards,
who while in charge of a small patrol party outside
Ladysmith, in October 1899, was nearly cornered by
the Boers. In retiring one of the troopers fell,
whereupon the lieutenant, galloping back, dismounted,
lifted the wounded man on to his shoulder, and with
his horse’s bridle over his arm walked back to rejoin
his comrades. And there was Lieutenant Sir John
Milbanke of the 10th Hussars, who saved the life of
one of his men while out on a reconnaissance near
Colesberg. The lieutenant himself was badly wounded
with a ball in his thigh, but disregarding this, he
went to the aid of the wounded man, who was exposed
to the Boer fire, and successfully brought him out of
range.</p>

<p>Both these heroes gained the V.C., as, too, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Private Bisdee and Lieutenant Wylly, of the Tasmanian
Imperial Bushmen, for gallantry of a like order.
Having run into an ambuscade, the scouting party of
which the Tasmanians were members had to get out
of it as best they could. The Boers from their cover
kept up a hot fire, and men and horses dropped
quickly. Out of the eight in the party all but two
were hit, and one of the officers had his horse shot
beneath him. Seeing his predicament, Private Bisdee
offered him a stirrup leather to hold on to, but the
other was more badly wounded than he had supposed.
Jumping off his horse, therefore, he put his officer into
the saddle, and mounting behind him, galloped out of
action. Lieutenant Wylly in his turn gave up his
horse to a wounded private, afterwards taking up a
position behind a rock, and using his rifle to good
purpose to cover the retreat of the little party.</p>

<p>It does one good to read of heroism such as this,
for it helps to keep alive our faith in those fine
qualities which have made Englishmen what they are.
If we still find something inspiring in the records of
the old sea-dogs, such as Benbow, who was carried on
deck in a basket after he had lost his leg, so that he
might continue to direct the fight, we may treasure in
our memories with no less reverence the deeds of
many humbler heroes. There is about them, too,
often enough, a truly British touch of dare-devilry,
cheek, pluck&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;that cannot but
strike one’s imagination.</p>

<p>Take the story of Sergeant T. Lawrence of the 17th
Lancers, the “Death or Glory Boys.” He was in
charge of a patrol in the neighbourhood of Lindley, in
August 1900, while the Lancer Brigade was chasing
De Wet. Suddenly attacked by a body of fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Boers, the patrol was obliged to retire. In the
gallop for safety Private Hayman’s horse was bowled
over, and down came its rider to the ground with a
dislocated shoulder and broken collar-bone. In a
twinkling the sergeant saw what had happened. The
Boers were hard upon their heels, but taking his
chance, Lawrence rode back to Hayman’s assistance.
The private’s horse being useless, Lawrence dismounted
and raised the wounded man on to his own steed, a
dun pony, it is recorded. Then, setting the animal’s
head for the picket and bidding Hayman hold on for
his life, the sergeant gave the pony a vigorous kick
and started him off. This done, Lawrence made his
way back on foot, keeping up a warm fire with his
carbine; and for <em>two</em> miles he retired thus, successfully
holding off the Boers, until a party which had
ridden out in search of him brought the plucky
fellow into our lines.</p>

<p>There is a true British ring about Sergeant
Lawrence’s action which is unmistakable, and few
South African heroes more deserved the V.C. which
was eventually bestowed upon him. He, thanks to
his skill with the carbine, and perhaps owing something
to luck, escaped without a scratch, but not all
were so fortunate. Writing of Lawrence reminds me
of another hero, Lieutenant and Adjutant G. H. B.
Coulson, of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, who
won glory and death at the same time.</p>

<p>It was during the rearguard action near Lambrecht
Fontein, in May 1901. A corporal of the Mounted
Infantry was wounded and helpless, so the lieutenant
pulled him up on to his own horse. As they rode along
the animal was itself struck, and it became evident
that a double burden was more than it could carry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
There was only one thing to be done. Slipping off
the horse, Coulson told the corporal to “hang on”
and save himself; then, revolver in hand, he stayed
behind, in the faint hope that he might win back to
safety on foot. It was a vain hope. The Boers rode
down upon him, and&mdash;one man against a hundred&mdash;he
fell riddled with bullets. Afterwards, when the
corporal had told his story, they gazetted Lieutenant
and Adjutant Coulson V.C., as one to
whom the decoration would have been awarded had
he lived.</p>

<p>Among other dead heroes of the South African
War, place must be found for Lieutenant Parsons of
the Essex Regiment and Sergeant Atkinson of the
Yorkshires. At Paardeberg, where a fierce battle was
fought in February 1900, many poor wounded fellows
lay in the sweltering heat suffering for want of water.
Water there was within reach, in the river that
wound round by the enemy’s trenches, but the task of
fetching it was attended with considerable danger.
Some four or five men made the attempt, only to fall
under the hail of Boer bullets. Nothing daunted,
however, both Parsons and Atkinson made several
dashes for the precious water, the former venturing
twice, and rendering much-needed relief to those
wounded near him.</p>

<p>Atkinson, who had distinguished himself in the
fight by rescuing Lieutenant Hammick of the Oxfordshire
Light Infantry, went down to the river no fewer
than seven times, being under fire all the while. At
the seventh venture his fate found him. A bullet
struck him in the head, and the brave Yorkshireman
fell mortally wounded. He was a son of Farrier-Major
James Atkinson, of the Royal Artillery, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
is stated to have been one of the party who captured
the original Sebastopol cannon from which the
Victoria Crosses are now cast. Although Lieutenant
Parsons survived Paardeberg, he never lived to receive
his Cross, being killed later at Driefontein.</p>

<p>For bravery that distinguishes itself in the storming
of apparently impregnable positions and in the leading
of forlorn hopes, the Highland regiments perhaps bear
the palm. One remembers their deeds in the Mutiny
days and, more recently, at Dargai. In South Africa
they wrote their names large, at Magersfontein,
Paardeberg, and in many a minor action.</p>

<p>One of their most dashing exploits was the capture
of Thaba Mountain, in April 1900, by the Gordons.
In this engagement Captain E. B. Towse, with but a
dozen men at his back, charged in the face of a
hundred and fifty Boers, who had climbed the hill
from the opposite side, and routed them. The
position was won and held, for the Highlanders&mdash;and
especially the Gordons&mdash;are men who like to have
their own way, but their brave leader paid dearly for
his victory. During the brief but fierce encounter
he was shot through both eyes and blinded for life.
This action at Thaba Mountain, together with his well-remembered
gallantry at Magersfontein, where in the
very fore-front of the battle he was seen helping
Colonel Downman, who was mortally wounded, gained
Captain Towse the V.C. Little wonder is it that as
she pinned it on the hero’s breast Queen Victoria was
moved to tears of sympathy and pity.</p>

<p>There were several V.C.’s gained in and around
Ladysmith during the memorable siege of that town
which well deserve mention. Listen to the story of
how Privates Scott and Pitts of the Manchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Regiment won the coveted decoration. In one of the
Boer assaults early in 1900 the Manchesters were
given the task of holding Cæsar’s Camp, a position in
the long ridge of hills to the north-east of the town.
Here they erected circular stone sangars, in each of
which a few men were posted with a plentiful supply
of ammunition.</p>

<p>When the attack was delivered, Cæsar’s Camp and
Waggon Hill in the vicinity received the brunt of it.
Before the Boer fire the Manchester Regiment in
particular suffered great loss, many of their sangars
being captured and occupied by the enemy; but there
was one spot in the defences that the Boers failed to
carry. In the little sangar where they had been
stationed Privates Scott and Pitts swore an oath that
they would never give up while breath was left in
their bodies, and for fifteen long hours their deadly
rifle fire kept the Boers at bay. In the end, as we
know, the enemy were compelled to withdraw baffled,
whereupon the two plucky privates who had “held
the fort” so manfully returned to camp smoke-blackened
and&mdash;in Scott’s case&mdash;wounded, to receive
the due reward of their heroism.</p>

<p>Yet another brave man of Ladysmith fame was
Private J. Barry of the Royal Irish. In the night
attack on Monument Hill in January 1901, he was
helping to work a Maxim when the Boers surrounded
the little party. His comrades having been all shot
down, Private Barry was called on to surrender, but
this word was not in his vocabulary. He neither
intended surrendering nor yielding his gun to the
enemy, so hurling a defiance at the latter, he proceeded
to smash the breech of the Maxim and render
it useless. A few quick blows were sufficient for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
purpose, and the work was done ere the infuriated
Boers raised their rifles and shot him dead.</p>

<p>A distinguished fellow-soldier of Barry’s was
Colour-Sergeant (now Captain) Masterson, the hero
of Waggon Hill. In the furious hand-to-hand fight
on the hill he was a conspicuous figure, only being
overborne at last by sheer force of numbers, and
falling with ten wounds in his body and limbs.
None of his injuries were mortal, however, and he
survived to receive the V.C. and a commission.</p>

<p>Captain Masterson’s name and rank, by the way,
vividly recall to one’s mind the exploit of a Royal
Irish Fusilier of earlier days, Sergeant Masterton,
the hero of Barossa. Masterton was known as “the
Eagle Taker,” for the dashing capture of a French
Eagle standard after a charge up a hill much in the
fashion of the Fusiliers at Waggon Hill, and he too
was rewarded by promotion.</p>

<p>With another story of the gallant gunners I must
bring this chapter to a close. The scene is Korn
Spruit, on the road between Thaban’chu and Bloemfontein.
On March 31st, 1900, two batteries of
the Royal Horse Artillery were making their way
to the Orange Free State capital, when they fell
into a Boer ambush. Before the alarm could be
raised five guns of the leading battery and a large
section of the baggage train had been captured.</p>

<p>Q Battery, under the command of Major Phipps-Hornby,
meanwhile was some three hundred yards
away from the spruit when the Boers opened fire,
and had time to wheel about into position. The
enemy’s force far outnumbered the British column,
but Major Phipps-Hornby and his gunners had no
idea of deserting their comrades. Having gained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
shelter of some railway buildings near at hand, the
battery&mdash;minus one gun which had had to be
abandoned&mdash;re-formed and at full gallop came again
into action. Within close range of the Boers they
unlimbered and opened fire, while the teams of
horses were taken back to the rear of the buildings
for safety.</p>

<p>For a long time the gunners served their pieces in
splendid style, but the order came at last to retire.
Realising how difficult it would be to hook the
teams on to the guns under the terrible fusillade
that the Boers were maintaining, Major Phipps-Hornby
decided to do without them. Under his
direction the men put their shoulders to the wheels
literally, helped by some officers and privates of
the Mounted Infantry, and by much pushing and
hauling they eventually got four of the five guns
round to the back of the buildings under cover,
saving some of the limbers at the same time.</p>

<p>To rejoin the main body now entailed the crossing
of a couple more spruits and a donga which lay
within easy range of the Boer guns, a veritable
zone of fire. But the gunners had faced danger
like this before, and at the call for volunteers many
drivers stepped forward. As quickly as possible the
horses were put into the traces, the guns hooked on,
and off they set, one at a time, on their perilous
journey. It was a wild dash for safety, but they got
home&mdash;all, that is, save one gun and one limber, which
after several attempts had to be left behind, all the
horses belonging to it being shot down.</p>

<p>It was a V.C. business, this saving of the guns, but
when it came to a question of making the award a
difficulty arose. Every man of the battery might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
said to have an equal claim to be decorated. As a
few Crosses only could be awarded, however, Rule 13
of the original Warrant had to be enforced, under
which the honour was conferred upon the battery
as a whole, one officer, one non-commissioned officer,
one gunner and one driver being elected by their
comrades as recipients. Of the two officers, Major
Phipps-Hornby and Captain Humphreys, who had
taken the leading part in the affair, each had displayed
conspicuous gallantry, and each with characteristic
generosity nominated the other for the decoration.
One would like to have seen both of them gazetted,
but the rule had to be adhered to, and, as senior
officer, the V.C. was presented to Major Phipps-Hornby.
Sergeant Parker, Gunner Lodge, and Driver
Glasock hold the other three Crosses of the corps
for this notable action.</p>

<p>Yet another hero of Korn Spruit is Lieutenant
(now Lieut.-Col.) F. A. Maxwell, of the Indian Army,
then attached to Roberts’ Light Horse. When the
Boer fire was concentrated on Q Battery, he volunteered
his assistance and faced the blizzard of lead
five times, helping to save two guns and three
limbers. It was he, too, who aided in the gallant
but futile attempt to bring in the fifth gun, remaining
exposed to shot and shell until the last moment.
For his bravery Lieutenant Maxwell was awarded the
V.C., and it is worthy of note that in announcing the
fact the <cite>Gazette</cite> refers to his gallantry during the
Chitral campaign, when he recovered the body of
Lieut.-Col. F. D. Battye, of the “Guides,” under a
heavy fire from the enemy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOMALILAND&mdash;NIGERIA&mdash;TIBET.</span></h2>

<p>Within the last four years we have seen three
campaigns of some importance which have
added several V.C.’s to the roll. In 1902-3 was
the punitive expedition against the Mad Mullah in
Somaliland, bringing distinction to Captain Cobbe
and others; in 1903 the rising in Nigeria, where,
at Sokoto, Captain Wallace Wright (of the Royal
West Surrey Regiment), with only one officer and
forty men, made a gallant stand for two hours against
the repeated charges of 1000 of the enemy’s cavalry
and 2000 infantry, eventually putting this large force
to rout; and in 1904 the Sikkim-Tibet Mission, which
yielded a V.C. to a young lieutenant of Ghurkas
named Grant. Of these campaigns that in Somaliland
heads the list with six Crosses, and the story
of how they were won well deserves to be told at length.</p>

<p>The first act of distinction was performed by
Captain (now Lieutenant-Colonel) A. S. Cobbe, D.S.O.,
at Erego, on October 6th, 1902. In the fight at this
place some of the companies were ordered to retire,
and Captain Cobbe suddenly found himself left alone
in the firing line with a Maxim. He saved the gun
from capture by the enemy, and bringing it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
worked it single-handed with such good effect that
he may be said to have turned the fortunes of the
day at a critical moment in the action. Later on
he went to the rescue of an orderly who had fallen
under the Somalis’ bullets, exposing himself not only
to the enemy’s fire but to that of his own men, who
were replying vigorously. For his gallantry Captain
Cobbe was gazetted V.C., receiving the decoration
from the hands of General Manning at Obbia, some
four months later.</p>

<p>With the fighting at Jidballi two V.C.’s are associated.
One is proudly worn by Lieutenant Herbert Carter for
saving the life of Private Jai Singh in the face of
a determined rush of dervishes; and the other by
Lieutenant Clement Leslie Smith, of the Duke of
Cornwall’s Light Infantry. The latter was serving
with the 5th Somali Mounted Infantry at the time.
In an onslaught made by the enemy from the bush
our men got broken up, and the combat resolved itself
into a hand-to-hand affair. Fighting desperately to
recover themselves, the Mounted Infantry rallied
bravely to their leader’s call, but little could be done
to stave off defeat. The loyal Somalis were driven
back, leaving many dead and wounded on the ground,
among the latter being one Rahamat Ali, a Hospital-Assistant.
Observing this man’s plight, Lieutenant
Smith and Dr. Welland of the R.A.M.C. made a
desperate attempt to save him.</p>

<p>They had almost succeeded in getting the wounded
man on to a horse when one of the many bullets that
rained upon them found him, and he was killed. The
Somalis now hemmed in the two officers on all sides,
so the lieutenant sought to bring out Dr. Welland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
hastily helping him to mount again. The doctor’s
horse was shot, however, as was a mule which was next
seized, and immediately after there was a rush, and
Welland was speared. Smith stood by him to the
end, endeavouring to keep off the enemy with his
revolver, but he had done all that mortal man could
do, and it was time to think of his own safety. At
that time the dervishes were swarming round him,
and, as the <cite>Gazette</cite> notes, it was marvellous indeed
that he escaped with his life.</p>

<p>But, notable as were these acts of bravery, it is
for the heroic attempt to rescue poor Captain Bruce
that the Somaliland campaign will perhaps be best
remembered. In that drama of savage warfare,
which brings home to us most vividly the difficulties
and dangers of bush fighting, three Crosses
were gained, inscribing the names of Rolland, Walker,
and Gough upon the roll of glory. This is the story
of it.</p>

<p>On April 22nd, 1903, Major Gough’s flying column,
which had been operating in the Daratoleh district,
began to fall back upon Danop, owing to shortness
in ammunition and the large number of wounded on
its hands. All around the little force, in the dense
bush, the enemy swarmed thickly, maintaining a harassing
fire upon the troops. During the afternoon the
rearguard became cut off from the main body, and
dropped considerably into the rear. With this section
were Captain Bruce, R.A., Major Gough’s staff officer,
and Captains Rolland and Walker of the Intelligence
Department, and when in a little time Bruce fell
badly wounded, the look-out for the little party
seemed bad indeed.</p>

<p>Having fired at and killed a savage whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
believed to have aimed the fatal shot, Captain Rolland
ran to his comrade’s assistance and dragged him to
one side of the forest path, where he would be less
exposed to the enemy’s fire. It was very evident
that the wound was mortal, but Rolland&mdash;who, by the
way, was an old Harrow boy, like Bruce&mdash;determined
to make every effort to save his friend’s body if he
could not save his life. While he attended to him
two Yaos (men of the King’s African Rifles), a Sikh
and a loyal Somali of the Camel Corps, bravely
stood by them, covering them with their rifles and
holding the enemy in check, the latter shouting
to each other in joyful anticipation of a speedy
victory.</p>

<p>Captain Bruce was a very heavy man, of nearly
fourteen stone, and Captain Rolland, who turned the
scale at nine and a half, found he could not lift the
other. None of the four men could stop firing to
help him, or the Somalis would have made a rush,
so the despairing officer shouted to the disappearing
column in front to halt. But the winding path soon
hid it from sight, and Rolland saw that he was left
to his fate. The enemy, becoming enboldened, now
pressed closer in, and the captain had to leave the
wounded man’s side and use his carbine and revolver
to drive the Somalis back into the bush again. It
was hot work, for the natives were in strong force
and armed with rifles in addition to their broad-bladed
throwing spears.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bruce got to his feet, and Rolland rushed
to hold him up; but it was the last flicker of life.
The wounded man lurched forward again and fell
on his face, dragging Rolland down with him. As
the latter turned him over on to his back, Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
opened his eyes and spoke for the last time.
“They’ve done for me this time, old man!” he
said, and a moment or two afterwards relapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>To Rolland’s great relief, he looked up from his
friend’s body to see Captain Walker “trekking”
towards him. His shout had been heard, after all.
Together the two tried to carry poor Bruce between
them, but it was no use; so Rolland decided to make a
dash for the rearguard to get help. It was a terribly
long run, and he thought he must get hit every
moment, as the bullets pinged about him. He got
through safely, however, and seized a Bikanir camel.
As he was leading this back he met Major Gough,
who asked what was the matter, and on being told
at once hastened to Bruce’s aid.</p>

<p>Rolland’s camel was desperately frightened at the
firing and shouting, and the captain had another bad
quarter of an hour as he coaxed it and urged it along
the bush path, but he reached the others without
mishap. With Gough and Walker he now lifted
Captain Bruce on to the kneeling camel, and as they
did so a third Somali bullet struck the wounded man,
almost immediately after which he died. At the same
time the Sikh, who had done his duty nobly in protecting
his officers, had his arm smashed by a fourth
bullet.</p>

<p>The little party were not left alone until 5.30 p.m.,
when, after some scattering shots, the enemy at last
drew off. “It was the hardest day of my life,” adds
Captain Rolland, in his account of the affair, and we
may well believe him. “I fired and fired in that
fight till my rifle was boiling hot; even the woodwork
felt on fire. Up to 3 a.m. a few biscuits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cocoa, then a 25-mile ride, a seven hours’ fight, and
25 miles back to camp; <i>i.e.</i> 50 miles that day; 25
hours without food of any kind, from the 3 a.m.
biscuits and cocoa on the 22nd to the 4 a.m. dinner
on the 23rd. Oh, the thirst of that day! I had
two water-bottles on my camel, and drained them
both. Hunger I did not feel.”</p>

<p>They buried Captain Bruce the next morning,
side by side with another officer who had been
killed, Captain Godfrey, laying them to rest just
as they were, in their stained khaki uniforms. The
silent African bush has many such graves in its
keeping.</p>

<p>It was not until some time later that the part
Major Gough had played in the rescue of Captain
Bruce’s body was brought to light. He had promptly
reported the heroic conduct of Captains Rolland and
Walker, but modestly omitted all mention of his
own share in the incident. And when the late
Mr. W. T. Maud, the artist-correspondent of the
<cite>Graphic</cite>, attempted to send home to his paper a full
account of the affair, the Major rigidly censored
the despatch so that his name did not occur
therein. His heroism, however, could not be overlooked,
and as soon as he was free from Major
Gough’s censorship Mr. Maud made public the true
story of the action, whereupon the V.C. was bestowed
upon the Major as well as upon Captains
Rolland and Walker.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Major John Edmond
Gough (now Lieutenant-Colonel) is a son of General
Sir C. J. S. Gough, V.C., and a nephew of that other
distinguished Indian veteran, General Sir H. H. Gough,
V.C. He thus establishes a record, for no other family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
has ever yet possessed three members entitled to wear
the decoration.</p>

<p class="tb">To Lieutenant John Duncan Grant, of the 8th
Ghurka Rifles, belongs the distinction of winning
the last Cross that has been awarded. The scene of
his exploit was Tibet, and the date July 6th, 1904.
On that day the storming of the Gyantse-jong, the
most formidable of the Tibetan strongholds, was
successfully carried out, the Ghurkas, as on many
a previous occasion, being called on to perform the
most ticklish part of the business.</p>

<p>The jong, or fort, at Gyantse is perched high up on
a hill, the approach being rendered difficult for an
enemy by the bare and almost precipitous nature of
the rock-face. There is scarcely any cover available,
and an attacking party is exposed to the fire from
the curtain and the flanking towers on both sides.
All day the artillery had been thundering at the
walls with little success, but at last a small breach
was made in the curtain, and it became possible for
a storming party to force its way through. It
became possible, I say, but the task was a truly
hazardous one. So little room was there that only
one man could go up at a time, crawling on his hands
and knees to the hole in the curtain.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant, however, with his brave little
Ghurkas, was not to be daunted by such heavy odds.
Leaving the cover of the village at the foot of the
hill, he led the advance up the steep slope. Immediately
behind him came Havildar Karbir Pun, as eager
to come to close quarters with the enemy as was his
leader. Up the slippery face of the cliff they scrambled,
while a shower of rocks and stones poured down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
them from the Tibetans above, to say nothing of
occasional volleys of jingal bullets; and as they
neared the top the lieutenant fell back wounded.
Nor did the havildar escape, being hurled back down
the rock for thirty feet or more.</p>

<p>Despite their injuries the intrepid couple made
another attempt after a brief pause. Covered by the
fire of their men, they dashed for the breach, and this
time succeeded in their purpose. Grant was the first
through, with the faithful Karbir Pun at his heels,
their rifles clearing a path for them as they scrambled
inside the jong. Then the rest of the Ghurkas
quickly poured in, and the issue of the assault was
no longer in doubt.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Grant was gazetted in January of the
year following. Havildar Karbir Pun&mdash;the sepoys
of our Indian army not being eligible for the V.C.&mdash;received
the Indian Order of Merit, which is its
equivalent, being conferred for conspicuous bravery
in the field.</p>

<p class="tb">And so this record of the Victoria Cross and its
heroes comes to a close. It is a brave record, indeed,
from Lucas down to Grant, and we may well be proud
of the gallant fellows, soldiers and sailors, British and
Colonials, whose names figure therein. Of late years
there has been some complaint that the decoration
is in danger of being cheapened by a too liberal distribution,
but I cannot think that such is the case.
The right to wear the coveted Cross is most jealously
guarded; only for acts of conspicuous bravery is it
granted; and he would be a bold man who dared to
place his finger on any one of the 522 names in the
list and say, “That man was not worthy.” How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
jealously the recipients guard the honour of the
decoration for their part is shown by the fact that
Rule 15 of the original Warrant has never had to
be enforced. No wearer of the V.C. has been struck
off the roll for “treason, cowardice, felony, or any
infamous crime.” And if at times we read of a
Victoria Cross being sold (almost invariably for a
large amount) to some collector, we may be sure
that another V.C. hero has joined the great majority.
The instances in which a recipient of the Cross has
parted with his decoration in his lifetime are very
rare, and this despite the most tempting offers for
the same that are known to have been made. For
no medal that can be won by the officers and men of
either Service is so highly prized when gained as
the little bronze Maltese cross bearing the golden
words, “<span class="smcap">For Valour</span>.”</p>

<h2 id="APPENDICES">APPENDICES</h2>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_A">APPENDIX A.<br />
<span class="smaller">ROYAL WARRANTS.</span></h3>

<p>The following are the principal Royal Warrants that have
been issued in connection with the Victoria Cross.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">War Department</span>, <i>February 5th, 1856.</i></p>

<p>The Queen has been pleased, by an instrument under her
Royal Sign Manual, of which the following is a copy, to institute
and create a new Naval and Military decoration, to be styled
and designated “The Victoria Cross,” and to make the rules and
regulations therein set forth under which the said decoration
shall be conferred.</p>

<p class="tb noindent"><span class="smcap">Victoria</span>, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, etc., to all
to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.</p>

<p>Whereas, We, taking into Our Royal Consideration, that
there exists no means of adequately rewarding the individual
gallant services, either of officers of the lower grades in Our
Naval and Military Service, or of warrant and petty officers,
seamen and marines in Our Navy, and non-commissioned officers
in Our Army. And, whereas, the third class of Our Most
Honourable Order of the Bath is limited, except in very rare
cases, to the higher ranks of both services, and the granting of
Medals, both in Our Navy and Army, is only awarded for long
service or meritorious conduct, rather than for bravery in action
or distinction before an enemy, such cases alone excepted where
a general medal is granted for a particular action or campaign,
or a clasp added to the medal for some especial engagement, in
both of which cases all share equally in the boon, and those who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
by their valour, have particularly signalised themselves, remain
undistinguished from their comrades. Now, for the purpose of
attaining an end so desirable as that of rewarding individual
instances of merit and valour, We have instituted and created,
and by these presents for Us, our Heirs and Successors, institute
and create a new Naval and Military Decoration, which We are
desirous should be highly prized and eagerly sought after by the
officers and men of Our Naval and Military Services, and are
graciously pleased to make, ordain and establish the following
rules and ordinances for the government of the same, which
shall from henceforth be inviolably observed and kept.</p>

<p><i>Firstly.</i> It is ordained that the distinction shall be styled
and designated “The Victoria Cross,” and shall consist of a
Maltese cross of Bronze, with Our Royal Crest in the centre,
and underneath with an escroll bearing the inscription “For
Valour.”</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> It is ordained that the Cross shall be suspended
from the left breast by a blue riband for the Navy, and by a red
riband for the Army.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> It is ordained that the names of those upon whom
We may be pleased to confer the Decoration shall be published
in the <cite>London Gazette</cite>, and a registry thereof kept in the Office
of Our Secretary of State for War.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> It is ordained that anyone who, after having
received the Cross, shall again perform an act of bravery, which,
if he had not received such Cross, would have entitled him to
it, such further act shall be recorded by a bar attached to the
riband by which the Cross is suspended, and for every additional
act of bravery an additional bar may be added.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i> It is ordained that the Cross shall only be awarded to
those officers and men who have served Us in the presence of the
enemy, and shall have then performed some signal act of valour
or devotion to their country.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly.</i> It is ordained, with a view to placing all persons on a
perfectly equal footing in relation to eligibility for the Decoration,
that neither rank, nor long service, nor wounds, nor any
other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of
conspicuous bravery, shall be held to establish a sufficient claim
to the honour.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly</i>. It is ordained that the Decoration may be conferred
on the spot where the act to be rewarded by the grant of such
Decoration has been performed, under the following circumstances:&mdash;1.
When the fleet or army in which such act has been
performed is under the eye and command of an admiral or
general officer commanding the forces. 2. Where the Naval or
Military force is under the eye and command of an admiral or
commodore commanding a squadron or detached Naval force, or
of a general commanding a corps or division or brigade on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
distinct and detached service, when such admiral or general
officer shall have the power of conferring the Decoration on the
spot, subject to confirmation by Us.</p>

<p><i>Eighthly.</i> It is ordained where such act shall not have been
performed in sight of a commanding officer as aforesaid, then
the claimant for the honour shall prove the act to the satisfaction
of the captain or officer commanding his ship, or to the officer
commanding the regiment to which the claimant belongs, and
such captain, or such commanding officer, shall report the same
through the usual channel to the admiral or commodore
commanding the force employed in the service, or to the officer
commanding the forces in the field who shall call for such
description and attestation of the act as he may think
requisite, and on approval shall recommend the grant of the
Decoration.</p>

<p><i>Ninthly.</i> It is ordained that every person selected for the
Cross, under Rule 7, shall be publicly decorated before the
Naval or Military force or body to which he belongs, and with
which the act of bravery for which he is to be rewarded
shall have been performed, and his name shall be recorded
in a general order together with the cause of his especial
distinction.</p>

<p><i>Tenthly.</i> It is ordained that every person selected under
Rule 8 shall receive his Decoration as soon as possible, and his
name shall likewise appear in a general order as above required,
such general order to be issued by the Naval or Military
commander of the forces employed on the Service.</p>

<p><i>Eleventhly.</i> It is ordained that the general orders above
referred to shall from time to time be transmitted to Our
Secretary of State for War, to be laid before Us, and shall be
by him registered.</p>

<p><i>Twelfthly.</i> It is ordained that, as cases may arise not falling
within the rules above specified, or in which a claim, though
well founded, may not have been established on the spot, We
will, on the joint submission of Our Secretary of State for War
and of Our Commander-in-Chief of Our Army, or on that of
Our Lord High Admiral, or Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty in the case of the Navy, confer the Decoration, but
never without conclusive proofs of the performance of the act of
bravery for which the claim is made.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenthly.</i> It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and
daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship’s company,
or detached body of seamen and marines not under fifty in
number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which
the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces
may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that
no special selection can be made by them, then in such case the
admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or
company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers
engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer
or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers
and non-commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or
private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen, or
private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration,
and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the
senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment,
troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding,
who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts
were done under his own eye.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenthly.</i> It is ordained that every warrant officer, petty
officer, seaman or marine, or non-commissioned officer, or soldier
who shall have received the Cross, shall, from the date of the
act by which the Decoration has been gained be entitled to a
special pension of £10 a year, and each additional bar conferred
under Rule 4 on such warrant or petty officers, or non-commissioned
officers or men, shall carry with it an additional
pension of £5 per annum.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenthly.</i> In order to make such additional provision as shall
effectually preserve pure this most honourable distinction, it is
ordained that, if any person be convicted of treason, cowardice,
felony, or of any infamous crime, or if he be accused of any such
offence, and doth not after a reasonable time surrender himself
to be tried for the same, his name shall forthwith be erased from
the registry of individuals upon whom the said Decoration shall
have been conferred, by an especial Warrant under Our Royal
Sign Manual, and the pension conferred under Rule 14 shall
cease and determine from the date of such Warrant. It is
hereby further declared, that We, Our Heirs and Successors,
shall be the all judges of the circumstances requiring such
expulsion; moreover, We shall at all times have power to restore
such persons as may at any time have been expelled, both to the
enjoyment of the Decoration and Pension.</p>

<p>Given at Our Court at Buckingham Palace, this twenty-ninth
day of January, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign, and in the
Year of Our Lord, 1856.</p>

<p class="center">By Her Majesty’s command,</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Panmure</span>.</p>

<p><i>To Our Principal Secretary of State for War.</i></p>

</div>

<p>On August 10, 1858, the <cite>London Gazette</cite> announced that by a
Warrant under her Royal Sign Manual, her Majesty was pleased
to direct that the Victoria Cross should be conferred, “subject to
the rules and ordinances already made, on Officers and Men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Her Majesty’s Naval and Military Services, who may perform
acts of conspicuous courage and bravery under circumstances of
extreme danger, such as the occurrence of a fire on board ship, or
of the foundering of a vessel at sea, or under any other circumstances
in which, through the courage and devotion displayed,
life or public property may be saved.”</p>

<p>As noted in chapter 15, it was under this clause that Private
O’Hea, Dr. Douglas, and several others were gazetted.</p>

<p class="tb">Provision for the award of the V.C. to Messrs. Kavanagh,
Mangles, and McDonell, who were civilians, was made by a
supplemental Warrant, which was announced in the <cite>Gazette</cite> on
8th July, 1859, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Queen having been graciously pleased by a Warrant
under her Royal Sign Manual, bearing date 13th December
1858, to declare that Non-Military Persons who, as Volunteers,
have borne arms against the Mutineers, both at Lucknow and
elsewhere, during the late operations in India, shall be considered
as eligible to receive the decoration of the Victoria Cross, subject
to the rules and ordinances, etc. etc. … provided that it be
established in any case that the person was serving under the
orders of a General or other Officer in Command of Troops in
the Field; her Majesty has accordingly been pleased to signify
her intention to confer this high distinction on the undermentioned
gentlemen, etc. etc.</p>

</div>

<p>The Warrant given below, which was issued in 1881, speaks
for itself. It merely restates in plain, unmistakable language
the purport of the original Warrant of 1856.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Royal Warrant.&mdash;Qualification required for the Decoration of the
Victoria Cross.</i></p>

<p class="center">(This Warrant applies also to the Auxiliary and Reserve Forces.)</p>

<p>Whereas doubts have arisen as to the qualification required
for the decoration of the Victoria Cross, and whereas the description
of such qualification in Our Warrant of 29th January, 1856, is
not uniform. Our will and pleasure is that the qualification
shall be “conspicuous bravery or devotion to the country in the
presence of the enemy,” and that Our Warrant of 29th January,
1856, shall be read and interpreted accordingly.</p>

<p>It is Our further will and pleasure that Officers and Men of
Our Auxiliary and Reserve Forces (Naval and Military) shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
eligible for the decoration of the Victoria Cross under the
conditions of Our said Warrant, as amended by this Our
Warrant.</p>

<p>Given at Our Court at Osborne, this 23rd day of April, 1881,
in the forty-fourth year of Our Reign.</p>

<p class="center">By Her Majesty’s Command,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hugh C. E. Childers</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In the same year, 1881, appeared another Warrant which
included as eligible for the Decoration members of the Indian
Ecclesiastical Establishment, provided that they were serving
under a general or other officer in command of troops in the
field. By this provision the Rev. J. W. Adams was gazetted V.C.</p>

<p class="tb">Under a later Warrant, dated July 18, 1898, authority was
given to increase the Victoria Cross pension from £10 to £50
a year, the condition to be satisfied in such cases being inability
to earn a livelihood, in consequence of age or infirmity occasioned
by causes beyond an Annuitant’s control.</p>

<p>The last Royal Warrant to be issued bears date August 8,
1902, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The King has been graciously pleased to approve of the
Decoration of the Victoria Cross being delivered to the <em>representatives</em>
of the undermentioned officers, non-commissioned
officers and men who fell during the recent operations in South
Africa, in the performance of acts of valour which would, in the
opinion of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Field,
have entitled them to be recommended for that distinction had
they survived:&mdash;(Here follow the names of Captain Younger,
Lieut. Digby-Jones, and others.)</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
